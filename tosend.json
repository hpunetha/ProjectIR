It is the most common of all involuntary movements and can affect the hands, arms, eyes, face, head, [[vocal folds]], trunk, and legs. Most tremors occur in the hands. In some people, a tremor is a symptom of another [[neurology|neurological]] disorder. A very common tremor is the teeth chattering, usually induced by cold temperatures or by fear.\n\n", "\nTremor can be a symptom associated with disorders in those parts of the brain that control muscles throughout the body or in particular areas, such as the hands. Neurological disorders or conditions that can produce tremor include [[multiple sclerosis]], [[stroke]], [[traumatic brain injury]], [[chronic kidney disease]] and a number of  [[neurodegenerative disease]]s that damage or destroy parts of the [[brainstem]] or the [[cerebellum]],  [[Parkinson's disease]] being the one most often associated with tremor. Other causes include the use of drugs (such as [[amphetamine]]s, [[cocaine]], [[caffeine]], [[corticosteroid]]s, [[SSRI]]s) or alcohol, [[mercury poisoning]], or the withdrawal of drugs such as alcohol or [[benzodiazepine withdrawal|benzodiazepine]]. Tremors can also be seen in infants with [[phenylketonuria]] (PKU), [[hyperthyroidism|overactive thyroid]] or [[liver failure]]. Tremors can be an indication of [[hypoglycemia]], along with palpitations, sweating and anxiety.<!-- Biochemistry 3rd ed. Lippinscott illustrated reviews.

See [[magnesium in biology]]. Some forms of tremor are inherited and run in families, while others have no known cause. Tremors can also be caused by some spider bites, e.g. the [[redback spider]] of Australia.\n\nCharacteristics may include a rhythmic shaking in the hands, arms, head, legs, or trunk; shaky voice; and problems holding things such as a fork or pen. Some tremors may be triggered by or become exacerbated during times of stress or strong emotion, when the individual is physically exhausted, or during certain postures or movements.\n\nTremor may occur at any age but is most common in middle-age and older persons. It may be occasional, temporary, or occur intermittently.

[[hemostasis]] and is an important part of both [[first aid]] and [[surgery]].\nThe use of [[Cyanoacrylate|cyanoacrylate glue]] to prevent bleeding and seal battle wounds was designed and first used in the [[Vietnam War]].  Today many medical treatments use a medical version of \"super glue\" instead of using traditional stitches used for small wounds that need to be closed at the skin level.\n\n==Classification ==\n[[File:Eye hemorrhage.jpg|thumbnail|A [[subconjunctival hemorrhage]] is a common and relatively minor post-[[LASIK]] complication.]]\n[[File:Linitis plastica 2.jpg|thumb|The endoscopic image of a type of stomach cancer known as [[linitis plastica]].

JE Tintinalli Ed. McGraw-Hill: New York, 2004, p. 227.</ref>\n\n*'''Class I Hemorrhage''' involves up to 15% of blood volume. There is typically no change in vital signs and [[fluid resuscitation]] is not usually necessary.\n*'''Class II Hemorrhage''' involves 15-30% of total blood volume. A patient is often [[Tachycardia|tachycardic]] (rapid heart beat) with a reduction in the difference between the [[Systole (medicine)|systolic]] and [[diastolic]] blood pressures. The body attempts to compensate with [[Vasoconstriction|peripheral vasoconstriction]]. Skin may start to look pale and be cool to the touch. The patient may exhibit slight changes in behavior. Volume resuscitation with crystalloids ([[Saline (medicine)|Saline solution]] or [[Lactated Ringer's solution]]) is all that is typically required. [[Blood transfusion]] is not usually required.\n*'''Class III Hemorrhage''' involves loss of 30-40% of circulating blood volume. The patient's [[blood pressure]] drops, the [[heart rate]] increases, peripheral hypoperfusion ([[shock (circulatory)|shock]]) with diminished [[capillary refill]] occurs, and the mental status worsens. Fluid resuscitation with crystalloid and blood transfusion are usually necessary.\n*'''Class IV Hemorrhage''' involves loss of >40% of circulating blood volume. The limit of the body's compensation is reached and aggressive resuscitation is required to prevent death.\n\nThis system is basically the same as used in the staging of [[hypovolemia|hypovolemic shock]].\n\nIndividuals in excellent physical and [[Circulatory system|cardiovascular]] shape may have more effective compensatory mechanisms before experiencing cardiovascular collapse. These patients may look deceptively stable, with minimal derangements in vital signs, while having poor peripheral perfusion. Elderly patients or those with chronic medical conditions may have less tolerance to blood loss, less ability to compensate, and may take medications such as betablockers that can potentially blunt the cardiovascular response. Care must be taken in the assessment.\n\n===Massive hemorrhage===\nAlthough there is no universally accepted definition of massive hemorrhage; the following can be used to identify the condition: \"(i) blood loss exceeding circulating blood volume within a 24-hour period, (ii) blood loss of 50% of circulating blood volume within a 3-hour period, (iii) blood loss exceeding 150 ml/min, or (iv) blood loss that necessitates plasma and platelet transfusion.\" <ref>Irita, K.

There are different types of [[wound]]s which may cause traumatic bleeding.  These include:\n\n* [[Abrasion (medical)|Abrasion]] - Also called a graze, this is caused by transverse action of a foreign object against the skin, and usually does not penetrate below the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]].\n* [[Excoriation]] - In common with Abrasion, this is caused by mechanical destruction of the skin, although it usually has an underlying medical cause.\n* [[Hematoma]] - Caused by damage to a blood vessel that in turn causes blood to collect under the skin.\n* [[Laceration]] - Irregular wound caused by blunt impact to soft tissue overlying hard tissue or tearing such as in childbirth.  In some instances, this can also be used to describe an incision.\n* [[Surgical incision|Incision]] - A cut into a body tissue or organ, such as by a [[scalpel]], made during surgery.\n* [[Penetrating trauma|Puncture Wound]] - Caused by an object that penetrated the skin and underlying layers, such as a nail, needle or knife.\n* [[Bruise|Contusion]] - Also known as a bruise, this is a blunt trauma damaging tissue under the surface of the skin.\n* [[Crush_injury|Crushing]] Injuries - Caused by a great or extreme amount of force applied over a period of time. The extent of a crushing injury may not immediately present itself.\n* [[Ballistic trauma|Ballistic Trauma]] - Caused by a projectile weapon such as a firearm. This may include two external wounds (entry and exit) and a contiguous wound between the two.\n\nThe pattern of injury, evaluation and treatment will vary with the mechanism of the injury. Blunt trauma causes injury via a shock effect; delivering energy over an area. Wounds are often not straight and unbroken skin may hide significant injury. Penetrating trauma follows the course of the injurious device. As the energy is applied in a more focused fashion, it requires less energy to cause significant injury. Any body organ, including bone and brain, can be injured and bleed. Bleeding may not be readily apparent; internal organs such as the liver, kidney and spleen may bleed into the abdominal cavity. The only apparent signs may come with blood loss. Bleeding from a bodily orifice, such as the rectum, nose, or ears may signal internal bleeding, but cannot be relied upon. Bleeding from a [[medical procedure]] also falls into this category.\n\n=== Medical condition ===\n\n\"Medical bleeding\" denotes hemorrhage as a result of an underlying medical condition (i.e. causes of bleeding that are not directly due to trauma). Blood can escape from [[blood vessel]]s as a result of 3 basic patterns of injury:\n\n* [[blood|Intravascular changes]] - changes of the blood within vessels (e.g. \u2191 [[blood pressure]], \u2193 [[clotting factors]])\n* [[blood vessel|Intramural changes]] - changes arising within the walls of blood vessels (e.g. [[aneurysms]], [[aortic dissection|dissections]], [[arteriovenous malformation|AVMs]], [[vasculitides]])\n* Extravascular changes - changes arising outside blood vessels (e.g. [[Helicobacter pylori|''H pylori'']] infection, [[brain abscess]], [[brain tumor]])\n\nThe underlying scientific basis for blood clotting and hemostasis is discussed in detail in the articles, [[blood coagulation|coagulation]], [[hemostasis]] and related articles. The discussion here is limited to the common practical aspects of blood clot formation which manifest as bleeding.\n\nSome medical conditions can also make patients susceptible to bleeding. These are conditions that affect the normal hemostatic (bleeding-control) functions of the body. Such conditions either are, or cause, [[bleeding diathesis|bleeding diatheses]]. [[Hemostasis]] involves several components. The main components of the hemostatic system include [[platelets]] and the [[blood coagulation|coagulation]] system.\n\n[[Platelets]] are small blood components that form a plug in the blood vessel wall that stops bleeding. Platelets also produce a variety of substances that stimulate the production of a blood clot. One of the most common causes of increased bleeding risk is exposure to [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs). The prototype for these drugs is aspirin, which inhibits the production of thromboxane. NSAIDs inhibit the activation of [[platelets]], and thereby increase the risk of bleeding. The effect of aspirin is irreversible; therefore, the inhibitory effect of aspirin is present until the platelets have been replaced (about ten days). Other NSAIDs, such as \"ibuprofen\" (Motrin) and related drugs, are reversible and therefore, the effect on platelets is not as long-lived.\n\nThere are several named coagulation factors that interact in a complex way to form blood clots, as discussed in the article on [[coagulation]]. Deficiencies of coagulation factors are associated with clinical bleeding.  For instance, deficiency of Factor VIII causes classic [[hemophilia A]] while deficiencies of Factor IX cause \"Christmas disease\"([[hemophilia B]]). Antibodies to Factor VIII can also inactivate the Factor VII and precipitate bleeding that is very difficult to control.  This is a rare condition that is most likely to occur in older patients and in those with [[autoimmune]] diseases. Another common bleeding disorder is [[Von Willebrand disease]]. It is caused by a deficiency or abnormal function of the \"Von Willebrand\" factor, which is involved in platelet activation. Deficiencies in other factors, such as factor XIII or factor VII are occasionally seen, but may not be associated with severe bleeding and are not as commonly diagnosed.\n\nIn addition to NSAID-related bleeding, another common cause of bleeding is that related to the medication, [[warfarin]] (\"Coumadin\" and others).  This medication needs to be closely monitored as the bleeding risk can be markedly increased by interactions with other medications.  Warfarin acts by inhibiting the production of [[Vitamin K]] in the gut.   Vitamin K is required for the production of the clotting factors, II, VII, IX, and X in the liver.  One of the most common causes of warfarin-related bleeding is taking antibiotics. The gut bacteria make vitamin K and are killed by antibiotics. This decreases vitamin K levels and therefore the production of these clotting factors.\n\nDeficiencies of platelet function may require platelet transfusion while deficiencies of clotting factors may require transfusion of either [[fresh frozen plasma]] or specific clotting factors, such as [[Factor VIII]] for patients with hemophilia.\n== Imaging ==\nDioxaborolane chemistry enables radioactive [[fluoride]] ([[Fluorine-18|<sup>18</sup>F]]) labeling of [[red blood cell]]s, which allows for [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) imaging of intracerebral hemorrhages.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Ye|last2=An|first2=Fei-Fei|last3=Chan|first3=Mark|last4=Friedman|first4=Beth|last5=Rodriguez|first5=Erik A|last6=Tsien|first6=Roger Y|last7=Aras|first7=Omer|last8=Ting|first8=Richard|date=2017-01-05|title=18F-positron-emitting/fluorescent labeled erythrocytes allow imaging of internal hemorrhage in a murine intracranial hemorrhage model|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0271678X16682510|journal=Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism|language=en|doi=10.1177/0271678x16682510}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"Haemorrhage\" (or ''h\u00e6morrhage'';  using the  [[American and British English spelling differences#ae and oe|\u00e6 ligature]]) comes from Latin haemorrhagia, from Ancient Greek \u03b1\u1f31\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 (haimorrhag\u00eda, \u201ca violent bleeding\u201d), from \u03b1\u1f31\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae\u03c2 (haimorrhag\u1e17s, \u201cbleeding violently\u201d), from \u03b1\u1f37\u03bc\u03b1 (ha\u00eema, \u201cblood\u201d) + -\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 (-rag\u00eda), from \u1fe5\u03b7\u03b3\u03bd\u03cd\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 .<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hemorrhage|title=''Hemorrhage'' Origin|publisher=[[dictionary.com]]|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Anaesthesia Trauma and Critical Care]]\n* [[Aneurysm]]\n* [[Autohaemorrhaging|Autohemorrhaging]]\n* [[Coagulation]]\n* [[Exsanguination]]\n* [[Hematophagy|Hemophage]]\n* [[Hemophilia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  DiseasesDB     = \n|  ICD10          = {{ICD10|R|58||r|50}}\n|  ICD9           = {{ICD9|459.0}}\n|  ICDO           =\n|  OMIM           =\n|  MedlinePlus    = 000045\n|  eMedicineSubj  =\n|  eMedicineTopic =\n|  MeshID         = D006470\n}}\n{{First aid topics}}\n\n{{Hemodynamics}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Bleeding| ]", "age|Haemorrhage|the song by [[Fuel (band)|Fuel]]|Hemorrhage (In My Hands)|the band|Haemorrhage (band)}}\n{{about||the deliberate extraction of blood|Bloodletting|other uses}}\n{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n| image           = Bleeding finger.jpg\n| caption         = A bleeding human finger\n| synonyms        = Hemorrhaging, haemorrhaging\n| field           = [[Emergency medicine]]\n| symptoms        = \n| complications   = \n| onset           = \n| duration        = \n| types           = \n| causes          = \n| risks           = \n| diagnosis       = \n| differential    = \n| prevention      = \n| treatment       = \n| medication      = \n| prognosis       = \n| frequency       = \n| deaths          = \n}}\n'''Bleeding''', also known as '''hemorrhaging''' or '''haemorrhaging''', is [[blood]] escaping from the [[circulatory system]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.healthline.com/adamcontent/bleeding|title=Bleeding Health Article|publisher=Healthline|accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref> Bleeding can occur internally, where blood leaks from [[blood vessel]]s inside the body, or externally, either through a natural opening such as the [[Mouth (human)|mouth]], [[human nose|nose]], [[ear]], [[urethra]], [[vagina]] or [[anus]], or through a break in the [[human skin|skin]].\n[[Hypovolemia]] is a massive decrease in blood volume, and death by excessive loss of blood is referred to as [[exsanguination]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/exsanguination|title=Dictionary Definitions of Exsanguination|publisher=Reference.com|accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref> Typically, a healthy person can endure a loss of 10\u201315% of the total blood volume without serious [[sequela|medical difficulties]] (by comparison, [[blood donation]] typically takes 8\u201310% of the donor's blood volume).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blood.co.uk/pages/b36faint.html|title=Blood Donation Information|publisher=UK National Blood Service|accessdate=2007-06-18 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928035216/http://www.blood.co.uk/pages/b36faint.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-28}}</ref> The stopping or controlling of bleeding is called [[hemostasis]] and is an important part of both [[first aid]] and [[surgery]].\nThe use of [[Cyanoacrylate|cyanoacrylate glue]] to prevent bleeding and seal battle wounds was designed and first used in the [[Vietnam War]].

The spleen usually lies in the left upper quadrant (LUQ) of the [[human abdomen]]. Splenomegaly is one of the four cardinal signs of ''hypersplenism'' which include; some reduction in the number of circulating blood cells affecting [[granulocytes]], [[erythrocytes]] or [[platelets]] in any combination, a compensatory proliferative response in the bone marrow, and the potential for correction of these abnormalities by [[splenectomy]]. Splenomegaly is usually associated with increased workload (such as in [[hemolytic anemia]]s), which suggests that it is a response to hyperfunction. It is therefore not surprising that splenomegaly is associated with any [[disease]] process that involves abnormal [[red blood cell]]s being destroyed in the spleen. Other common causes include congestion due to [[portal hypertension]] and infiltration by [[leukemias]] and [[lymphomas]]. Thus, the finding of an enlarged spleen, along with [[caput medusae|caput medusa]], is an important sign of portal hypertension.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ghazi|first=Ali|title=Hypercalcemia and huge splenomegaly presenting in an elderly patient with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: a case report|journal=Journal of Medical Case Reports|year=2010|volume=4|issue=334|url=http://www.jmedicalcasereports.com/content/4/1/330 | doi = 10.1186/1752-1947-4-330}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Gray1217.png|thumb|right|upright|Normal spleen]]\n\n==Definition==\nThe standard system for classifying splenomegaly on [[radiography]] is:<ref>{{cite web|title=Splenomegaly|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/206208-overview|author=Neetu Radhakrishnan|website=Medscape|access-date=February 16, 2018}} Updated Apr. 2012 (referring the classification system to Poulin ''et al.''</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=DdBJ6jCf8KgC&pg=PA1964 Page 1964] in: {{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Molecular Mechanisms of Disease|author=Florian Lang|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|year=2009|isbn=9783540671367}}</ref>\n* Normal (not splenomegaly): the largest dimension is less than 11&nbsp;cm\n* Moderate splenomegaly: the largest dimension is between 11\u201320&nbsp;cm\n* Severe splenomegaly: the largest dimension is greater than 20&nbsp;cm\nAlso, a [[cutoff (reference value)|cutoff]] of a craniocaudal height of 13&nbsp;cm is also used to define splenomegaly.<ref name=\"SabooKrajewski2012\">{{cite journal|last1=Saboo|first1=S S|last2=Krajewski|first2=K M|last3=O'Regan|first3=K N|last4=Giardino|first4=A|last5=Brown|first5=J R|last6=Ramaiya|first6=N|last7=Jagannathan|first7=J P|title=Spleen in haematological malignancies: spectrum of imaging findings|journal=The British Journal of Radiology|volume=85|issue=1009|year=2012|pages=81\u201392|issn=0007-1285|doi=10.1259/bjr/31542964|accessdate=February 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSplenomegaly refers strictly to spleen enlargement, and is distinct from hypersplenism, which connotes overactive function by a spleen of any size.

Diagnosis must take into account such things as the appearance of the rash, other symptoms, what the patient may have been exposed to, occupation, and occurrence in family members. A rash can last 5 to 20 days, the diagnosis may confirm any number of conditions.\nThe presence of a rash may aid diagnosis; associated signs and symptoms are diagnostic of certain diseases.

The feeling that one is about to vomit is called [[nausea]], which often precedes, but does not always lead to, vomiting. [[Antiemetic]]s are sometimes necessary to suppress nausea and vomiting. In severe cases, where [[dehydration]] develops, [[intravenous]] fluid may be required. Self-induced vomiting can be a component of an eating disorder, such as [[bulimia nervosa]], and is itself now an eating disorder on its own, [[purging disorder]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/09/20/new-eating-disorder-no-binge-just-purge.html|title=New Eating Disorder: No Binge, Just Purge|date=20 September 2007|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nVomiting is different from [[regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitation]], although the two terms are often used interchangeably. Regurgitation is the return of undigested food back up the [[esophagus]] to the [[mouth]], without the force and displeasure associated with vomiting. The causes of vomiting and regurgitation are generally different.\n\n==Complications==\n\n===Aspiration===\nVomiting can be dangerous if the gastric content enters the [[respiratory tract]]. Under normal circumstances the [[gag reflex]] and [[coughing]] prevent this from occurring; however, these protective reflexes are compromised in persons under the influences of certain substances such as [[ethanol|alcohol]] or [[anesthesia]]. The individual may choke and [[asphyxiation|asphyxiate]] or suffer an [[aspiration pneumonia]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n=== Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance ===\nProlonged and excessive vomiting depletes the body of water (dehydration), and may alter the electrolyte status. Gastric vomiting leads to the loss of acid (protons) and chloride directly. Combined with the resulting [[alkaline tide]], this leads to [[hypochloremia|hypochloremic]] [[metabolic alkalosis]] (low [[chloride]] levels together with high {{chem|link=bicarbonate|HCO|3|-}} and {{chem|CO|2}} and increased blood [[pH]]) and often [[hypokalemia]] ([[potassium]] depletion). The hypokalemia is an indirect result of the [[kidney]] compensating for the loss of acid. With the loss of intake of food the individual may eventually become [[cachexia|cachectic]]. A less frequent occurrence results from a vomiting of intestinal contents, including bile acids and {{chem|HCO|3|-}}, which can cause [[metabolic acidosis]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Mallory\u2013Weiss tear===\n{{see also|Mallory\u2013Weiss syndrome}}\nRepeated or profuse vomiting may cause erosions to the [[esophagus]] or small tears in the esophageal mucosa ([[Mallory\u2013Weiss syndrome|Mallory\u2013Weiss tear]]). This may become apparent if fresh red blood is mixed with vomit after several episodes.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Dentistry===\nRecurrent vomiting, such as observed in [[bulimia nervosa]], may lead to destruction of the [[tooth enamel]] due to the acidity of the vomit.

They are as follows:{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n* Increased [[saliva]]tion to protect [[tooth enamel]] from stomach acids. (Excessive vomiting leads to [[Erosion (dental)|dental erosion]]). This is part of the PNS output.\n* The body takes a deep breath to avoid [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspirating]] vomit.\n* [[Retroperistalsis]] starts from the middle of the [[small intestine]] and sweeps up digestive tract contents into the stomach, through the relaxed [[pylorus|pyloric sphincter]].\n* Intrathoracic pressure lowers (by [[Inhalation|inspiration]] against a closed [[glottis]]), coupled with an increase in abdominal pressure as the [[abdomen|abdominal muscles]] contract, propels stomach contents into the [[esophagus]] as the [[cardia|lower esophageal sphincter]] relaxes. The stomach itself does not contract in the process of vomiting except for at the [[Angular incisure|angular notch]], nor is there any retroperistalsis in the esophagus.\n* Vomiting is ordinarily preceded by [[retching]].\n* Vomiting also initiates an [[Sympathetic nervous system|SNS]] response causing both sweating and increased heart rate.\n\nThe [[neurotransmitter]]s that regulate vomiting are poorly understood, but inhibitors of [[dopamine]], [[histamine]], and [[serotonin]] are all used to suppress vomiting, suggesting that these play a role in the initiation or maintenance of a vomiting cycle. [[Vasopressin]] and [[neurokinin]] may also participate.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n=== Phases ===\n\nThe vomiting act has two phases.  In the retching phase, the abdominal muscles undergo a few rounds of coordinated contractions together with the diaphragm and the muscles used in respiratory inspiration. For this reason, an individual may confuse this phase with an episode of violent [[hiccups]]. In this retching phase, nothing has yet been expelled. In the next phase, also termed the expulsive phase, intense pressure is formed in the stomach brought about by enormous shifts in both the diaphragm and the abdomen.  These shifts are, in essence, vigorous contractions of these muscles that last for extended periods of time - much longer than a normal period of muscular contraction.  The pressure is then suddenly released when the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes resulting in the expulsion of gastric contents. Individuals who do not regularly exercise their abdominal muscles may experience pain in those muscles for a few days. The relief of pressure and the release of endorphins into the bloodstream after the expulsion causes the vomiter to feel better.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Contents===\n[[Gastric acid|Gastric secretions]] and likewise vomit are highly [[acid]]ic. Recent food intake appears in the gastric vomit. Irrespective of the content, vomit tends to be [[odor|malodorous]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe content of the vomitus (vomit) may be of medical interest. Fresh [[blood]] in the vomit is termed [[hematemesis]] (\"blood vomiting\"). Altered blood bears resemblance to coffee grounds (as the [[iron]] in the blood is [[oxidation|oxidized]]) and, when this matter is identified, the term [[coffee ground vomiting|coffee-ground vomiting]] is used. [[Bile]] can enter the vomit during subsequent heaves due to [[duodenum|duodenal]] contraction if the vomiting is severe. Fecal vomiting is often a consequence of [[intestinal obstruction]] or a gastrocolic [[fistula]] and is treated as a warning sign of this potentially serious problem (''signum mali ominis'').{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIf the vomiting reflex continues for an extended period with no appreciable vomitus, the condition is known as non-productive emesis or \"dry heaves\", which can be painful and debilitating.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n;Color of vomit{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n*Bright red in the vomit suggests bleeding from the esophagus\n*Dark red vomit with liver-like clots suggests profuse bleeding in the stomach, such as from a perforated ulcer\n*Coffee-ground-like vomit suggests less severe bleeding in the stomach, because the gastric acid has had time to change the composition of the blood\n*Yellow vomit suggests bile, indicating that the [[pyloric valve]] is open and bile is flowing into the stomach from the duodenum (this is more common in older people)\n\n==Differential diagnosis==\nVomiting may be due to a large number of causes, and protracted vomiting has a long [[differential diagnosis]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Digestive tract===\nCauses in the [[digestive tract]]\n* [[Gastritis]] (inflammation of the gastric wall)\n* [[Gastroenteritis]]\n* [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease]]\n* [[Celiac disease]]<ref name=SymptomsCausesNIDDK>{{cite web|title=Symptoms & Causes of Celiac Disease {{!}} NIDDK|url=https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/celiac-disease/symptoms-causes|website=National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases|accessdate=24 April 2017|date=June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424175500/https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/celiac-disease/symptoms-causes|archivedate=24 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* [[Non-celiac gluten sensitivity]]<ref name=VoltaCaio2017>{{cite journal| vauthors=Volta U, Caio G, Karunaratne TB, Alaedini A, De Giorgio R| title=Non-coeliac gluten/wheat sensitivity: advances in knowledge and relevant questions. | journal=Expert Review of Gastroenterology & Hepatology | year= 2017 | volume= 11 | issue= 1 | pages= 9-18 | pmid=27852116 | doi=10.1080/17474124.2017.1260003 | type=Review | quote=A lower proportion of NCG/WS patients (from 30% to 50%) complain of upper gastrointestinal tract manifestations, e.g. vomiting, nausea, gastroesophageal reflux disease, aerophagia and aphthous stomatitis.

These may be infrequent, frequent, or continuous. Some of these arrhythmias are harmless (though distracting for patients) but some of them predispose to adverse outcomes.\n\nSome arrhythmias do not cause symptoms, and are not associated with increased mortality.  However, some asymptomatic arrhythmias ''are'' associated with adverse events.  Examples include a higher risk of blood clotting within the heart and a higher risk of insufficient blood being transported to the heart because of weak heartbeat. Other increased risks are of embolisation and stroke, heart failure and sudden cardiac death.\n\nIf an arrhythmia results in a heartbeat that is too fast, too slow or too weak to supply the body's needs, this manifests as a lower blood pressure and may cause lightheadedness or dizziness, or syncope ([[fainting]]).\n\nSome types of arrhythmia result in [[cardiac arrest]], or sudden death.\n\nMedical assessment of the abnormality using an [[electrocardiogram]] is one way to diagnose and assess the risk of any given arrhythmia.\n\n==Differential diagnosis==\n\n===Normal electrical activity===\n{{Main|Electrical conduction system of the heart}}\n\nEach heart beat originates as an electrical impulse from a small area of tissue in the right [[atrium (heart)|atrium]] of the heart called the [[sinoatrial node|sinus node or Sino-atrial node or SA node]]. The impulse initially causes both atria to contract, then activates the [[electrical conduction system of the heart#Depolarization and the ECG|atrioventricular (or AV) node]], which is normally the only electrical connection between the atria and the [[ventricle (heart)|ventricles]] (main pumping chambers).  The impulse then spreads through both ventricles via the [[Bundle of His]] and the [[Purkinje fibres]] causing a synchronised contraction of the heart muscle and, thus, the pulse.\n\nIn adults the normal resting heart rate ranges from 60 to 90 beats per minute. The resting heart rate in children is much faster. In athletes, however, the resting heart rate can be as slow as 40 beats per minute, and be considered as normal.\n\nThe term [[Respiratory sinus arrhythmia|sinus arrhythmia]] <ref>{{cite journal | author = Hayano J | date = Feb 2004 | title = Respiratory sinus arrhythmia: why does the heartbeat synchronize with respiratory rhythm? | url = | journal = Chest | volume = 125 | issue = 2| pages = 683\u201390 | doi=10.1378/chest.125.2.683 | pmid=14769752}}</ref> refers to a normal phenomenon of alternating mild acceleration and slowing of the heart rate that occurs with breathing in and out.  It is usually quite pronounced in children and steadily decreases with age. This can also be present during [[meditation]] breathing exercises that involve deep inhaling and breath holding patterns.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.ijcard.2009.06.058 | volume=145 | title=Heart rate dynamics in different levels of Zen meditation | journal=International Journal of Cardiology | pages=142\u2013146}}</ref>\n\n===Bradycardias===\n\n[[Image:Sinus pause.PNG|thumb|Normal sinus rhythm, with solid black arrows pointing to normal P waves representative of normal sinus node function, followed by a pause in sinus node activity (resulting in a transient loss of heart beats). Note that the P wave that disrupts the pause (indicated by the dashed arrow) does not look like the previous (normal) P waves &mdash; this last P wave is arising from a different part of the atrium, representing an escape rhythm.]]\nA slow rhythm (less than 60 beats/min), is labelled [[bradycardia]]. This may be caused by a slowed signal from the sinus node (sinus bradycardia), a pause in the normal activity of the sinus node (sinus arrest), or by blocking of the electrical impulse on its way from the atria to the ventricles (AV block or heart block). Heart block comes in varying degrees and severity. It may be caused by reversible poisoning of the AV node (with drugs that impair conduction) or by irreversible damage to the node.  Bradycardias may also be present in the normally functioning heart of endurance athletes or other well-conditioned persons. Bradycardia may also occur in [[Ictal bradycardia|some types of seizures]].\n\n===Tachycardias===\n\nIn adults and children over 15, resting heart rate faster than 100 beats per minute is labelled [[tachycardia]].  Tachycardia may result in  palpitation; however, tachycardia is not ''necessarily'' an arrhythmia. Increased heart rate is a normal response to physical exercise or emotional stress.  This is mediated by the [[sympathetic nervous system]] on the [[sinus node]] and called sinus tachycardia.  Other conditions that increase sympathetic nervous system activity in the heart include ingested or injected substances, such as [[caffeine]] or [[amphetamines]], and an overactive thyroid gland ([[hyperthyroidism]]) or [[anemia]].\n\nTachycardia that is not sinus tachycardia usually results from the addition of abnormal impulses to the normal [[cardiac cycle]].  Abnormal impulses can begin by one of three mechanisms: automaticity, re-entry or triggered activity.  A specialised form of re-entry which is both common and problematic is termed fibrillation.\n\nAlthough the term \"tachycardia\" has been known for over 160 years, bases for the classification of arrhythmias are still being discussed.<ref name=\"b-Moskalenko-2012\">{{cite book|last1   =Moskalenko|first1   =A.|authorlink1   =|authorlink2   =|chapter   =Tachycardia as \u201cShadow Play\u201d|trans-chapter=|chapterurl   =http://www.intechopen.com/books/tachycardia/tachycardia-as-shadow-play-|editor-last   =Yamada|editor-first   =Takumi|editor-link   =|title   =Tachycardia|url   =http://www.intechopen.com/books/tachycardia|location   =Croatia|publisher   =InTech|year   =2012|pages   =97\u2013122|isbn   =978-953-51-0413-1|deadurl   =no|archiveurl   =https://web.archive.org/web/20130508011115/http://www.intechopen.com/books/tachycardia|archivedate   =2013-05-08|df   =}}</ref>\n\n===Heart defects===\nCongenital heart defects are structural or electrical pathway problems in the heart that are present at birth.  Anyone can be affected with this because overall health does not play a role in the problem.  Problems with the electrical pathway of the heart can cause very fast or even deadly arrhythmias.  [[Wolff\u2013Parkinson\u2013White syndrome]] is due to an extra pathway in the heart that is made up of electrical muscle tissue.  This tissue allows the electrical impulse, which stimulates the heartbeat, to happen very rapidly.  Right [[Ventricular outflow tract]] Tachycardia is the most common type of ventricular tachycardia in otherwise healthy individuals.  This defect is due to an electrical node in the right ventricle just before the pulmonary artery.  When the node is stimulated, the patient will go into ventricular tachycardia, which does not allow the heart to fill with blood before beating again.  [[Long QT Syndrome]] is another complex problem in the heart and has been labeled as an independent factor in mortality.    There are multiple methods of treatment for these including cardiac ablations, medication treatment, or altering your lifestyle to have less stress and exercise.  It is possible to live a full and happy life with these conditions.\n\n===Automaticity===\n\n{{Main|Automatic tachycardia}}\n\nAutomaticity refers to a [[cardiac muscle]] cell firing off an impulse on its own.  All of the cells in the heart have the ability to initiate an [[action potential]]; however, only some of these cells are designed to routinely trigger heart beats.  These cells are found in the conduction system of the heart and include the SA node, AV node, Bundle of His and Purkinje fibers.  The [[sinoatrial node]] is a single specialized location in the atrium that has a higher automaticity (a faster pacemaker) than the rest of the heart and, therefore, is usually responsible for setting the heart rate and initiating each heart beat.\n\nAny part of the heart that initiates an impulse without waiting for the sinoatrial node is called an [[Cardiac ectopy|ectopic]] focus and is, by definition, a pathological phenomenon. This may cause a single premature beat now and then, or, if the [[ectopic focus]] fires more often than the sinoatrial node, it can produce a sustained abnormal rhythm. Rhythms produced by an ectopic focus in the atria, or by the [[atrioventricular node]], are the least dangerous dysrhythmias; but they can still produce a decrease in the heart's pumping efficiency, because the signal reaches the various parts of the heart muscle with different timing than usual and can be responsible for poorly coordinated contraction.\n\nConditions that increase automaticity include [[sympathetic nervous system]] stimulation and [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. The resulting heart rhythm depends on where the first signal begins: If it is the sinoatrial node, the rhythm remains normal but rapid; if it is an ectopic focus, many types of dysrhythmia may ensue.\n\n===Re-entry===<!-- This section is linked from [[Myocardial infarction]], and redirected from Re-entrant arrhythmia -->\nRe-entrant arrhythmias occur when an electrical impulse recurrently travels in a tight circle within the heart, rather than moving from one end of the heart to the other and then stopping.<ref name=\"a- Wiener-1946\">{{cite journal |pmid=20245817 |year=1946 |last1=Wiener |first1=Norbert |last2=Rosenblueth |first2=Arturo |title=The mathematical formulation of the problem of conduction of impulses in a network of connected excitable elements, specifically in cardiac muscle |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=205\u201365 |journal=Archivos del Instituto de Cardiolog\u00eda de M\u00e9xico}}</ref><ref name=\"a- Allessie-1976\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1161/01.RES.39.2.168 |title=Circus movement in rabbit atrial muscle as a mechanism of tachycardia.

Normally, the [[action potential]] impulse will spread through the heart quickly enough that each cell will respond only once.  However, if there is some essential heterogeneity of [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]] or if conduction is abnormally slow in some areas (for example in heart damage) so the myocardial cells are unable to activate the fast sodium channel, part of the impulse will arrive late and potentially be treated as a new impulse. Depending on the timing, this can produce a sustained abnormal circuit rhythm.\n\nAs a sort of ''re-entry'', vortices of excitation in the myocardium ([[Autowave|autowave vortices]]) are considered to be the main mechanism of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias.<ref name=\"b-Mandel-1995\">{{cite book |editor-last   = Mandel |editor-first  = William J. |title     = Cardiac Arrhythmias: Their Mechanisms, Diagnosis, and Management |location  =  |publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |edition   = 3 |year      = 1995 |isbn      = 978-0-397-51185-3}}</ref> In particular, the [[autowave reverberator]] is common in the thin walls of the atria, sometimes resulting in [[atrial flutter]]. Re-entry is also responsible for most [[paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia]], and dangerous [[ventricular tachycardia]]. These types of re-entry circuits are different from [[WPW]] syndromes, which utilize abnormal conduction pathways.\n\nAlthough [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s from [[fish oil]] can be protective against arrhythmias, they can facilitate re-entrant arrhythmias.<ref name=\"a- Coronel-2007\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.06.014 |title=Pro- and antiarrhythmic properties of a diet rich in fish oil |year=2007 |last1=Denruijter |first1=H |last2=Berecki |first2=G |last3=Opthof |first3=T |last4=Verkerk |first4=A |last5=Zock |first5=P |last6=Coronel |first6=R |journal=Cardiovascular Research |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=316\u201325 |pmid=16859661}}</ref>\n\n===Fibrillation===\nWhen an entire chamber of the heart is involved in multiple micro-reentry circuits and is therefore quivering with chaotic electrical impulses, it is said to be in fibrillation.\n\nFibrillation can affect the atrium ([[atrial fibrillation]]) or the ventricle ([[ventricular fibrillation]]): ventricular fibrillation is imminently life-threatening.\n\n* Atrial fibrillation affects the upper chambers of the heart, known as the [[Atrium (heart)|atria]]. Atrial fibrillation may be due to serious underlying medical conditions and should be evaluated by a [[physician]]. It is not typically a medical emergency.\n* Ventricular fibrillation occurs in the [[ventricle (heart)|ventricles]] (lower chambers) of the heart; it is always a medical emergency. If left untreated, [[ventricular fibrillation]] (VF, or V-fib) can lead to death within minutes. When a heart goes into V-fib, effective pumping of the blood stops. V-fib is considered a form of [[cardiac arrest]]. An individual suffering from it will not survive unless [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) and [[defibrillation]] are provided immediately.\n\nCPR can prolong the survival of the [[brain]] in the lack of a normal pulse, but defibrillation is the only intervention that can restore a healthy heart rhythm. Defibrillation is performed by applying an electric shock to the heart, which resets the cells, permitting a normal beat to re-establish itself.\n\n===Triggered beats===\nTriggered beats occur when problems at the level of the ion channels in individual heart cells result in abnormal propagation of electrical activity and can lead to sustained abnormal rhythm. They are relatively rare and can result from the action of anti-arrhythmic drugs. See early and delayed [[Afterdepolarization]]s.\n\n==Mechanism==\n\nTachyarrhythmias are the result of spontaneous action potentials arise from cardiac muscle cells.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shen|first1=H|last2=Choe|first2=W|title=Spontaneous high-frequency action potential.|journal=Science China. Life sciences|date=April 2011|volume=54|issue=4|pages=311-35|doi=10.1007/s11427-011-4157-y|pmid=21509656}}</ref>\n\n==Diagnostic approach==\nCardiac arrhythmia are often first detected by simple but nonspecific means: [[auscultation]] of the heartbeat with a [[stethoscope]], or feeling for peripheral [[pulse]]s. These cannot usually diagnose specific arrhythmia but can give a general indication of the heart rate and whether it is regular or irregular. Not all the electrical impulses of the heart produce audible or palpable beats; in many cardiac arrhythmias, the premature or abnormal beats do not produce an effective pumping action and are experienced as \"skipped\" beats.\n\nThe simplest ''specific'' diagnostic test for assessment of heart rhythm is the [[electrocardiogram]] (abbreviated ECG or EKG). A [[Holter monitor]] is an EKG recorded over a 24-hour period, to detect arrhythmias that may happen briefly and unpredictably throughout the day.\n\nA more advanced study of the heart's electrical activity can be performed to assess the source of the [[cardiac aberration|aberrant]] heart beats. This can be accomplished in an [[electrophysiology study]], an [[endovascular procedure]] that uses a catheter to \"listen\" to the electrical activity from within the heart, additionally if the source of the arrhythmias is found, often the abnormal cells can be ablated and the arrhythmia can be permanently corrected. ''{{visible anchor|Transesophageal atrial stimulation}}'' (TAS) instead uses an electrode inserted through the [[esophagus]] to a part where the distance to the posterior wall of the [[left atrium]] is only approximately 5\u20136&nbsp;mm (remaining constant in people of different age and weight).<ref name=\"MeigasKaik2008\">{{cite journal|last1=Meigas|first1=K|last2=Kaik|first2=J|last3=Anier|first3=A|title=Device and methods for performing transesophageal stimulation at reduced pacing current threshold|journal=Estonian Journal of Engineering|volume=57|issue=2|year=2008|pages=154|issn=1736-6038|doi=10.3176/eng.2008.2.05}}</ref> Transesophageal atrial stimulation can differentiate between [[atrial flutter]], [[AV nodal reentrant tachycardia]] and orthodromic [[atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia]].<ref name=\"PehrsonBlomstr\u00f6-LUNDQVIST1994\"/> It can also evaluate the risk in people with [[Wolff\u2013Parkinson\u2013White syndrome]], as well as terminate [[supraventricular tachycardia]] caused by [[Cardiac arrhythmia#Re-entry|re-entry]].<ref name=\"PehrsonBlomstr\u00f6-LUNDQVIST1994\">{{cite journal|last1=Pehrson|first1=Steen M.|last2=Blomstr\u00f6-LUNDQVIST|first2=Carina|last3=Ljungstr\u00f6|first3=Erik|last4=Blomstr\u00f6|first4=Per|title=Clinical value of transesophageal atrial stimulation and recording in patients with arrhythmia-related symptoms or documented supraventricular tachycardia-correlation to clinical history and invasive studies|journal=Clinical Cardiology|volume=17|issue=10|year=1994|pages=528\u2013534|issn=0160-9289|doi=10.1002/clc.4960171004|pmid=8001299}}</ref>\n\n==Management==\nThe method of cardiac rhythm management depends firstly on whether the affected person is stable or unstable. Treatments may include physical maneuvers, medications, electricity conversion, or electro- or cryo-cautery.\n\nIn the United States, people admitted to the hospital with cardiac arrhythmia and conduction disorders with and without complications were admitted to the intensive care unit more than half the time in 2011.<ref>{{cite web | vauthors = Barrett ML, Smith MW, Elizhauser A, Honigman LS, Pines JM | title = Utilization of Intensive Care Services, 2011 | work = HCUP Statistical Brief #185 | publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality | location = Rockville, MD | date = December 2014 | url = https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb185-Hospital-Intensive-Care-Units-2011.jsp | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402162800/https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb185-Hospital-Intensive-Care-Units-2011.jsp | archivedate = 2015-04-02 | df =  }}</ref>\n\n===Physical maneuvers===\nA number of physical acts can increase parasympathetic nervous supply to the heart, resulting in blocking of electrical conduction through the AV node.  This can slow down or stop a number of arrhythmias that originate above or at the AV node (see main article: [[supraventricular tachycardia]]s).  Parasympathetic nervous supply to the heart is via the [[vagus nerve]], and these maneuvers are collectively known as [[vagal maneuver]]s.\n\n===Antiarrhythmic drugs===\n{{Main|Antiarrhythmic agents}}\n\nThere are many classes of antiarrhythmic medications, with different mechanisms of action and many different individual drugs within these classes.  Although the goal of drug therapy is to prevent arrhythmia, nearly every anti arrhythmic drug has the potential to act as a pro-arrhythmic, and so must be carefully selected and used under medical supervision.\n\n===Other drugs===\nA number of other drugs can be useful in cardiac arrhythmias.\n\nSeveral groups of drugs slow conduction through the heart, without actually preventing an arrhythmia.  These drugs can be used to \"rate control\" a fast rhythm and make it physically tolerable for the patient.\n\nSome arrhythmias promote blood clotting within the heart, and increase risk of embolus and stroke.  [[Anticoagulant]] medications such as [[warfarin]] and [[heparin]]s, and anti-platelet drugs such as [[aspirin]] can reduce the risk of clotting.\n\n===Electricity===\nArrhythmias may also be treated electrically, by applying a shock across the heart&nbsp;\u2014 either externally to the chest wall, or internally to the heart via implanted electrodes.\n\n[[Cardioversion]] is either achieved pharmacologically or via the application of a shock ''synchronised'' to the underlying heartbeat.  It is used for treatment of supraventricular tachycardias. In elective cardioversion, the recipient is usually sedated or lightly [[anesthesia|anesthetized]] for the procedure.\n\n[[Defibrillation]] differs in that the shock is not synchronised.  It is needed for the chaotic rhythm of ventricular fibrillation and is also used for pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Often, more electricity is required for defibrillation than for cardioversion. In most defibrillation, the recipient has lost consciousness so there is no need for sedation.\n\nDefibrillation or cardioversion may be accomplished by an [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]] (ICD).\n\nElectrical treatment of arrhythmias also includes [[cardiac pacing]]. Temporary pacing may be necessary for reversible causes of very slow heartbeats, or [[bradycardia]], (for example, from [[drug overdose]] or [[myocardial infarction]]). A permanent [[artificial pacemaker|pacemaker]] may be placed in situations where the bradycardia is not expected to recover.\n\n===Electrical cautery===\nSome cardiologists further sub-specialise into electrophysiology.  In specialised [[catheter|catheter laboratories]], they use fine probes inserted through the blood vessels to map electrical activity from within the heart.  This allows abnormal areas of conduction to be located very accurately, and subsequently destroyed with heat, cold, electrical, or laser probes.\n\nThis procedure may be completely curative for some forms of arrhythmia, but for others, the success rate remains disappointing. [[AV nodal reentrant tachycardia]] is often curable by ablating one of the pathways in the [[Atrioventricular node|AV node]] . [[Atrial fibrillation]] can also be treated, by performing a [[pulmonary vein]] isolation, but the results are less reliable.\n\n==Research==\nArrhythmias due to medications have been reported since the 1920s with the use of [[quinine]].<ref name=Hei2010/> In the 1960s and 1970s problems with antihistamines and antipsychotics were discovered.<ref name=Hei2010/> It was not until the 1980s that the

Glutamate maintains the resting discharge of the central vestibular neurons, and may modulate [[chemical synapse|synaptic transmission]] in all three neurons of the VOR arc. Acetylcholine appears to function as an excitatory neurotransmitter in both the peripheral and central synapses. [[Gamma-Aminobutyric acid]] (GABA) is thought to be inhibitory for the commissures of the [[medial vestibular nucleus]], the connections between the cerebellar [[Purkinje cells]], and the [[lateral vestibular nucleus]], and the vertical VOR.\n\nThree other neurotransmitters work centrally. [[Dopamine]] may accelerate vestibular compensation. [[Norepinephrine]] modulates the intensity of central reactions to vestibular stimulation and facilitates compensation. [[Histamine]] is present only centrally, but its role is unclear.

qualities of real perception. Hallucinations are vivid, substantial, and are perceived to be located in external objective space. They are distinguishable from several related [[phenomena]], such as [[dream]]ing, which does not involve wakefulness; [[pseudohallucination]], which does not mimic real perception, and is accurately perceived as unreal; [[illusion]], which involves distorted or misinterpreted real perception; and [[mental imagery|imagery]], which does not mimic real perception and is under voluntary control.<ref name=\"Chiu\">{{cite journal|author=Leo P.

These may be things like seeing movement in [[peripheral vision]], or hearing faint noises and/or voices. Auditory hallucinations are very common in [[schizophrenia]]. They may be benevolent (telling the subject good things about themselves) or malicious, cursing the subject, etc. [[Auditory hallucinations]] of the malicious type are frequently heard,{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} for example people talking about the subjects behind their back. Like auditory hallucinations, the source of the visual counterpart can also be behind the subject's back. Their visual counterpart is the feeling of being looked or stared at, usually with malicious intent.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Frequently, auditory hallucinations and their visual counterpart are experienced by the subject together.{{Citation needed|reason= Your statement is not supported by any valid source|date=December 2017}}\n\n[[Hypnagogic hallucination]]s and [[hypnopompia|hypnopompic hallucinations]] are considered normal phenomena. Hypnagogic hallucinations can occur as one is falling asleep and hypnopompic hallucinations occur when one is waking up. Hallucinations can be associated with [[Psychoactive drug|drug]] use (particularly [[deliriant]]s), [[sleep deprivation]], [[psychosis]], [[neurological disorder]]s, and [[delirium tremens]].\n\nThe word \"hallucination\" itself was introduced into the English language by the 17th-century physician Sir [[Thomas Browne]] in 1646 from the derivation of the Latin word ''alucinari'' meaning to wander in the mind. For Browne, hallucination means a sort of vision that is \"depraved and receive[s] its objects erroneously\".<ref>Browne, Thomas (1646). ''Pseudodoxia Epidemica.'' Book III, chapter XVIII: That Moles are blinde and have no eyes.</ref>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Classification==\nHallucinations may be manifested in a variety of forms.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Chen E, Berrios GE |title=Recognition of hallucinations: a multidimensional model and methodology|journal=Psychopathology|volume=29|issue=1|pages=54\u201363|year=1996|pmid=8711076|doi=10.1159/000284972}}</ref> Various forms of hallucinations affect different senses, sometimes occurring simultaneously, creating multiple sensory hallucinations for those experiencing them.\n\n===Visual===\n{{see also|Visual hallucinations in psychosis|Pareidolia|Palinopsia}}\n\nA visual hallucination is \"the perception of an external visual stimulus where none exists\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pelak|first1=Victoria|title=Approach to the patient with visual hallucinations|url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations|website=www.uptodate.com|accessdate=2014-08-25}}</ref> Alternatively, a visual illusion is a distortion of a real external stimulus. Visual hallucinations are separated into simple and complex.\n* Simple visual hallucinations (SVH) are also referred to as non-formed visual hallucinations and elementary visual hallucinations. These terms refer to lights, colors, geometric shapes, and indiscrete objects. These can be further subdivided into [[phosphenes]] which are SVH without structure, and [[photopsias]] which are SVH with geometric structures.\n* Complex visual hallucinations (CVH) are also referred to as formed visual hallucinations. CVHs are clear, lifelike images or scenes such as people, animals, objects, etc.\n\nFor example, one may report hallucinating a giraffe. A simple visual hallucination is an amorphous figure that may have a similar shape or color to a giraffe (''looks like'' a giraffe), while a complex visual hallucination is a discrete, lifelike image that ''is'', unmistakably, a giraffe.\n\n===Auditory===\n{{main|Auditory hallucination}}\n[[Sound|Auditory]] hallucinations (also known as ''paracusia'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/paracusia|title=Paracusia|publisher=thefreedictionary.com}}</ref> are the perception of sound without outside stimulus. Auditory hallucinations are the most common type of hallucination.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nolen-Hoeksema|first1=Susan|title=Abnormal Psychology|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|pages=283|edition=6e|accessdate=}}</ref> Auditory hallucinations can be divided into two categories: elementary and complex. Elementary hallucinations are the perception of sounds such as hissing, whistling, an extended tone, and more. In many cases, tinnitus is an elementary auditory hallucination. However, some people who experience certain types of tinnitus, especially pulsatile tinnitus, are actually hearing the blood rushing through vessels near the ear. Because the auditory stimulus is present in this situation, it does not qualify it as a hallucination.\n\nComplex hallucinations are those of voices, music, or other sounds that may or may not be clear may be familiar or completely unfamiliar, and friendly or aggressive, among other possibilities. A hallucination of a single individual person of one or more talking voices is particularly associated with [[psychosis|psychotic]] disorders such as [[schizophrenia]], and hold special significance in diagnosing these conditions.\n\nIf a group of people experience a complex auditory  hallucination, no single individual can be named psychotic or schizophrenic.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/09/us/utah-baby-alive-submerged-car/ \"Rescuers heard a voice\" Ben Brumfield, CNN March 9, 2015]</ref><ref>[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/mysterious-voice-leads-police-baby-car-crash-article-1.2142732 \"'Mysterious voice' led Utah Officers to child who survived for 14 hours in submerged car\" Joel Landau, New York Daily News, March 9, 2015]</ref><ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/utah-rescuers-recall-pulling-toddler-overturned-car-river-n319831 \"Lily Groesbeck Rescue\" NBC news]</ref><ref>[http://www.ksl.com/index.php?sid=33747089&nid=148&title=rescuers-recall-distinct-voice-that-spurred-them-to-rescue-trapped-toddler&fm=home_page&s_cid=topstory  \"Rescuers recall 'distinct voice' that spurred them to rescue trapped toddler\" Pat Reavy, KSL newsradio, March 8, 2015]</ref>\n\nAnother typical disorder where auditory hallucinations are very common is [[dissociative identity disorder]]. In schizophrenia voices are normally perceived coming from outside the person but in dissociative disorders they are perceived as originating from within the person, commenting in their head not behind their back. Differential diagnosis between schizophrenia and [[dissociative disorders]] is challenging due to many overlapping symptoms especially [[Kurt Schneider|Schneiderian first rank symptoms]] such as hallucinations.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Shibayama M|year=2011|title=Differential diagnosis between dissociative disorders and schizophrenia|journal=Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi|volume=113|issue=9| pages=906\u2013911|pmid=22117396 }}</ref> However, many people not suffering from diagnosable [[mental illness]] may sometimes hear voices as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/7177-hearing-voices-people.html|title=Hearing Voices: Some People Like It|last=Thompson|first=Andrea|publisher=LiveScience.com|date=September 15, 2006|accessdate=2006-11-25 }}</ref> One important example to consider when forming a differential diagnosis for a patient with paracusia is lateral [[temporal lobe epilepsy]]. Despite the tendency to associate hearing voices, or otherwise hallucinating, and [[psychosis]] with schizophrenia or other psychiatric illnesses, it is crucial to take into consideration that, even if a person does exhibit psychotic features, he/she does not necessarily suffer from a psychiatric disorder on its own. Disorders such as [[Wilson's disease]], various [[endocrine diseases]], numerous [[metabolic disturbance]]s, [[multiple sclerosis]], [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], [[porphyria]], [[sarcoidosis]], and many others can present with psychosis.\n\nMusical hallucinations are also relatively common in terms of complex auditory hallucinations and may be the result of a wide range of causes ranging from hearing-loss (such as in [[musical ear syndrome]], the auditory version of [[Charles Bonnet syndrome]]), lateral temporal lobe epilepsy,<ref>Engmann, Birk; Reuter, Mike: \"Spontaneous perception of melodies \u2013 hallucination or epilepsy?\" ''Nervenheilkunde'' 2009 Apr 28: 217-221. {{ISSN|0722-1541}}</ref> arteriovenous malformation,<ref name=\"pmid19682829\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Ozsarac M, Aksay E, Kiyan S, Unek O, Gulec FF |title=De novo cerebral arteriovenous malformation: Pink Floyd's song \"Brick in the Wall\" as a warning sign|journal=The Journal of Emergency Medicine|volume=43|issue=1|pages=e17\u201320|year=2012|pmid=19682829|doi=10.1016/j.jemermed.2009.05.035}}</ref> stroke, [[lesion]], [[abscess]], or tumor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2000/08/000809065249.htm|title=Rare Hallucinations Make Music In The Mind|publisher=ScienceDaily.com|date=August 9, 2000|accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Hearing Voices Movement]] is a support and advocacy group for people who hallucinate voices, but do not otherwise show signs of mental illness or impairment.\n\nHigh [[caffeine]] consumption has been linked to an increase in the likelihood of one's experiencing auditory hallucinations.

These hallucinations usually occur in the evenings, but not during drowsiness, as in the case of hypnagogic hallucination. The subject is usually fully conscious and then can interact with the hallucinatory characters for extended periods of time.

Sleep is disturbed and occurs for a shorter period of time, with [[rapid eye movement sleep]].\n\n===Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia===\n[[Parkinson's disease]] is linked with [[Dementia with Lewy bodies|Lewy body dementia]] for their similar hallucinatory symptoms. The symptoms strike during the evening in any part of the visual field, and are rarely [[wikt:polymodal|polymodal]]. The segue into hallucination may begin with illusions<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/14/health/14case.html?ex=1151121600&en=04560d31e7926bee&ei=5070 Mark Derr (2006)] \"Marilyn and Me,\" ''The New York Times'', February 14, 2006 <br></ref> where sensory perception is greatly distorted, but no novel sensory information is present.

Insight into these hallucinations is usually preserved and [[REM sleep]] is usually reduced. Parkinson's disease is usually associated with a degraded [[substantia nigra]] pars compacta, but recent evidence suggests that PD affects a number of sites in the brain. Some places of noted degradation include the median [[raphe nuclei]], the [[noradrenergic]] parts of the [[locus coeruleus]], and the [[cholinergic]] neurons in the [[parabrachial area]] and [[pedunculopontine]] nuclei of the [[tegmentum]].<ref name=manford/>\n\n===Migraine coma===\n{{see also|Migraine aura|Scintillating scotoma}}\nThis type of hallucination is usually experienced during the recovery from a comatose state. The migraine coma can last for up to two days, and a state of depression is sometimes [[Comorbidity|comorbid]]. The hallucinations occur during states of full consciousness, and insight into the hallucinatory nature of the images is preserved. It has been noted that ataxic lesions accompany the migraine coma.<ref name=manford/>\n\n===Charles Bonnet syndrome===\n[[Charles Bonnet syndrome]] is the name given to visual hallucinations experienced by a partially or severely sight impaired person. The hallucinations can occur at any time and can distress people of any age, as they may not initially be aware that they are hallucinating, they may fear initially for their own mental health which may delay them sharing with carers what is happening until they start to understand it themselves. The hallucinations can frighten and disconcert as to what is real and what is not and carers need to learn how to support sufferers. The hallucinations can sometimes be dispersed by eye movements, or perhaps just reasoned logic such as, \"I can see fire but there is no smoke and there is no heat from it\" or perhaps \"We have an infestation of rats but they have pink ribbons with a bell tied on their necks.\" Over elapsed months and years the manifestation of the hallucinations may change, becoming more or less frequent with changes in ability to see. The length of time that the sight impaired person can suffer from these hallucinations varies according to the underlying speed of eye deterioration. A differential diagnosis are ophthalmopathic hallucinations.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Engmann, Birk |title=Phosphene und Photopsien \u2013 Okzipitallappeninfarkt oder Reizdeprivation? |trans-title=Phosphenes and photopsias - ischaemic origin or sensorial deprivation? - Case history |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Neuropsychologie |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=7\u201313 |year=2008 |doi=10.1024/1016-264X.19.1.7 |language=German }}</ref>\n\n===Focal epilepsy===\nVisual hallucinations due to [[focal seizures]] differ depending on the region of the brain where the seizure occurs. For example, visual hallucinations during [[occipital lobe]] seizures are typically visions of brightly colored, geometric shapes that may move across the [[visual field]], multiply, or form concentric rings and generally persist from a few seconds to a few minutes. They are usually unilateral and localized to one part of the visual field on the contralateral side of the seizure focus, typically the [[Temporal lobe|temporal field]].

Complex hallucinations may appear to be real or unreal, may or may not be distorted with respect to size, and may seem disturbing or affable, among other variables. One rare but notable type of hallucination is [[heautoscopy]], a hallucination of a mirror image of one's self. These \"other selves\" may be perfectly still or performing complex tasks, may be an image of a younger self or the present self, and tend to be only briefly present.

Rarely, they may occur during occipital focal seizures or in [[parietal lobe]] seizures.<ref name=\"Panayiotopoulos_2007\" />\n\nDistortions in visual perception during a temporal lobe seizure may include size distortion ([[micropsia]] or [[macropsia]]), distorted perception of movement (where moving objects may appear to be moving very slowly or to be perfectly still), a sense that surfaces such as ceilings and even entire horizons are moving farther away in a fashion similar to the [[Dolly zoom|dolly zoom effect]], and other illusions.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Bien CG, Benninger FO, Urbach H, Schramm J, Kurthen M, Elger CE |title=Localizing value of epileptic visual auras|journal=Brain|volume=123|issue=2|pages=244\u2013253|year=2000|pmid=10648433|doi=10.1093/brain/123.2.244}}</ref> Even when consciousness is impaired, insight into the hallucination or illusion is typically preserved.\n\n===Drug-induced hallucination===\n{{main|Hallucinogen}}\nDrug-induced hallucinations are caused [[hallucinogens]], [[dissociatives]], [[deliriants]] including many drugs with [[anticholinergic]] actions and certain stimulants, which are known to cause visual and auditory hallucinations. Some psychedelics such as [[lysergic acid diethylamide]] (LSD) and [[psilocybin]] can cause hallucinations that range from a spectrum of mild to severe.\n\nHallucinations, [[pseudohallucinations]], or intensification of [[pareidolia]], particularly auditory, are known side effects of [[opioids]] to different degrees -- it may be associated with the absolute degree of agonism and/or antagonism of especially the [[kappa opioid receptor]], [[sigma receptors]], [[delta opioid receptor]] and the [[NMDA receptors]] or the overall receptor activation profile as synthetic opioids like those of the [[pentazocine]], [[levorphanol]], [[fentanyl]], [[pethidine]], [[methadone]] and some other families are more associated with this side effect than natural opioids like [[morphine]] and [[codeine]] and semi-synthetics like [[hydromorphone]], amongst which there also appears to be a stronger correlation with the relative analgesic strength.  Three opioids, [[Cyclazocine]] (a benzormorphan opioid/pentazocine relative) and two levorphanol-related [[morphinan]] opioids, [[Cyclorphan]] and [[Dextorphan]] are classified as hallucinogens, and [[Dextromethorphan]] as a dissociative. <ref>https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/fentanyl-transdermal-route/side-effects/drg-20068152</ref> <ref>https://healthquestions.medhelp.org/fentanyl-hallucinations</ref> <ref>https://www.drugs.com/pro/talwin-injection.html</ref> <ref>https://healthyliving.azcentral.com/prescription-drugs-that-can-cause-hallucinations-12212355.html</ref>  These drugs also can induce sleep (relating to hypnagogic hallucinations) and expecially the pethidines have atropine-like [[anticholinergic]] activity, which was possibly also a limiting factor in the use, the psychotomometic side effects of [[potentiating]] morphine, [[oxycodone]], and other opioids with [[scopolamine]] (respectively in the Twilight Sleep technique and the combination drug Skophedal, which was eukodal (oxycodone), scopolamine and ephedrine, called the \"wonder drug of the 1930s\" after its invention in Germany in 1928, but only rarely specially compounded today) (q.q.v) <ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0030422057800632</ref>\n\n===Sensory deprivation hallucination===\nHallucinations can be caused by [[sense deprivation]] when it occurs for prolonged periods of time, and almost always occur in the modality being deprived (visual for blindfolded/darkness, auditory for muffled conditions, etc.) {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n===Experimentally-induced hallucinations===\n{{Main|Hallucinations in the sane}}\n'''Anomalous experiences''', such as so-called benign hallucinations, may occur in a person in a state of good mental and physical health, even in the apparent absence of a transient trigger factor such as [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]] or [[sensory deprivation]].\n\nThe evidence for this statement has been accumulating for more than a century.

Hallucinations are vivid, substantial, and are perceived to be located in external objective space. They are distinguishable from several related [[phenomena]], such as [[dream]]ing, which does not involve wakefulness; [[pseudohallucination]], which does not mimic real perception, and is accurately perceived as unreal; [[illusion]], which involves distorted or misinterpreted real perception; and [[mental imagery|imagery]], which does not mimic real perception and is under voluntary control.<ref name=\"Chiu\">{{cite journal|author=Leo P.

These may be things like seeing movement in [[peripheral vision]], or hearing faint noises and/or voices. Auditory hallucinations are very common in [[schizophrenia]]. They may be benevolent (telling the subject good things about themselves) or malicious, cursing the subject, etc. [[Auditory hallucinations]] of the malicious type are frequently heard,{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} for example people talking about the subjects behind their back. Like auditory hallucinations, the source of the visual counterpart can also be behind the subject's back. Their visual counterpart is the feeling of being looked or stared at, usually with malicious intent.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Frequently, auditory hallucinations and their visual counterpart are experienced by the subject together.{{Citation needed|reason= Your statement is not supported by any valid source|date=December 2017}}\n\n[[Hypnagogic hallucination]]s and [[hypnopompia|hypnopompic hallucinations]] are considered normal phenomena.

For Browne, hallucination means a sort of vision that is \"depraved and receive[s] its objects erroneously\".<ref>Browne, Thomas (1646). ''Pseudodoxia Epidemica.''

Deeper areas can be detected by [[electromyography]] (EMG) testing, though they can happen in any [[skeletal muscle]] in the body. Fasciculations arise as a result of ''spontaneous depolarization'' of a [[lower motor neuron]] leading to the synchronous contraction of all the skeletal muscle fibers within a single motor unit. An example of normal spontaneous depolarization is the constant contractions of [[cardiac muscle]], causing the [[heart]] to beat. Usually, intentional movement of the involved muscle causes fasciculations to cease immediately, but they may return once the muscle is at rest again.\n\nFasciculations have a variety of causes, the majority of which are [[benign]], but can also be due to disease of the motor neurons. They are encountered by virtually all healthy people, though for most, it is quite infrequent. In some cases, the presence of fasciculations can be annoying and interfere with [[quality of life]]. If a [[neurological examination]] is otherwise normal and EMG testing does not indicate any additional [[pathology]], a diagnosis of  [[benign fasciculation syndrome]] is usually made.<ref name=\"pmid8215252 \">{{cite journal |vauthors=Blexrud MD, Windebank AJ, Daube JR |title=Long-term follow-up of 121 patients with benign fasciculations |journal=Ann.

In particular, these include [[ethanolamine]]s such as [[diphenhydramine]] (brand names Benadryl, Dimedrol, Daedalon and Nytol), used as an [[antihistamine]] and [[sedative]], and [[dimenhydrinate]] (brand names Dramamine, Driminate, Gravol, Gravamin, Vomex, and Vertirosan) for [[nausea]] and [[motion sickness]]. Persons with [[benign fasciculation syndrome]] (BFS) may experience [[paraesthesia]] (especially [[numbness]]) shortly after taking such medication; fasciculation episodes begin as the medication wears off.\n\n[[Stimulant]]s can cause fasciculations directly. These include [[caffeine]], [[pseudoephedrine]] (Sudafed), [[amphetamines]], and the [[asthma]] [[bronchodilator]]s [[salbutamol]] (brand names Proventil, Combivent, Ventolin). Medications used to treat [[ADHD|attention deficit disorder]] (ADHD) often contain stimulants as well, and are common causes of benign fasciculations. Since asthma and ADHD are much more serious than the fasciculations themselves, this [[side effect]] may have to be tolerated by the patient after consulting a physician or pharmacist.\n\nThe depolarizing neuromuscular blocker [[succinylcholine]] causes fasciculations. It is a normal side effect of the drug's administration, and can be prevented with a small dose of a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocker prior to the administration of succinylcholine, often 10% of a nondepolarizing NMB's induction dose.\n\nEven if a drug such as caffeine causes fasciculations, that does not necessarily mean it is the only cause. For example, a very slight [[Magnesium deficiency (medicine)|magnesium deficiency]] by itself (see below) might not be enough for fasciculations to occur, but when combined with caffeine, the two factors together could be enough. \n\n==Treatment==\n{{medref|section|date=January 2015}}\nInadequate [[magnesium]] intake can cause fasciculations, especially after a magnesium loss due to severe [[diarrhea]].

Treatment consists of increased intake of magnesium from dietary sources such as [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]] (especially [[almonds]]), [[bananas]], and [[spinach]]. Magnesium supplements or [[Magnesium (pharmaceutical preparation)|pharmaceutical magnesium preparations]] may also be taken. However, too much magnesium may cause [[diarrhea]], resulting in dehydration and nutrient loss (including magnesium itself, leading to a net loss, rather than a gain). It is well known as a [[laxative]] ([[Magnesium hydroxide|Milk of Magnesia]]), though [[Chelation|chelated]] magnesium can largely reduce this effect. Cheaper methods of the chelation process may be unsatisfactory for some people . Magnesium supplements recommend that they be taken only with meals, and not on an empty stomach.\n\nFasciculation also often occurs during a rest period after sustained stress, such as that brought on by unconsciously tense muscles.

Deeper areas can be detected by [[electromyography]] (EMG) testing, though they can happen in any [[skeletal muscle]] in the body. Fasciculations arise as a result of ''spontaneous depolarization'' of a [[lower motor neuron]] leading to the synchronous contraction of all the skeletal muscle fibers within a single motor unit. An example of normal spontaneous depolarization is the constant contractions of [[cardiac muscle]], causing the [[heart]] to beat. Usually, intentional movement of the involved muscle causes fasciculations to cease immediately, but they may return once the muscle is at rest again.\n\nFasciculations have a variety of causes, the majority of which are [[benign]], but can also be due to disease of the motor neurons. They are encountered by virtually all healthy people, though for most, it is quite infrequent. In some cases, the presence of fasciculations can be annoying and interfere with [[quality of life]]. If a [[neurological examination]] is otherwise normal and EMG testing does not indicate any additional [[pathology]], a diagnosis of  [[benign fasciculation syndrome]] is usually made.<ref name=\"pmid8215252 \">{{cite journal |vauthors=Blexrud MD, Windebank AJ, Daube JR |title=Long-term follow-up of 121 patients with benign fasciculations |journal=Ann.

A lower bound to temperature is [[absolute zero]], defined as 0.00{{nbsp}}K on the [[Kelvin scale]], an absolute [[thermodynamic temperature]] scale. This corresponds to {{convert|0|K|C|2|disp=out}} on the [[Celsius scale]], {{convert|0|K|F|2|disp=out}} on the [[Fahrenheit scale]], and {{convert|0|K|R|2|disp=out}} on the [[Rankine scale]].\n\nSince temperature relates to the [[thermal energy]] held by an object or a sample of matter, which is the [[kinetic energy]] of the random motion of the particle constituents of matter, an object will have less thermal energy when it is colder and more when it is hotter. If it were possible to cool a system to absolute zero, all motion of the particles in a sample of matter would cease and they would be at complete rest in this ''classical'' sense. The object would be described as having zero thermal energy. Microscopically in the description of [[quantum mechanics]], however, matter still has [[zero-point energy]] even at absolute zero, because of the [[uncertainty principle]].\n\n==Cooling==\n{{Main|Refrigeration}}\n\nCooling refers to the process of becoming cold, or lowering in [[temperature]]. This could be accomplished by removing heat from a system, or exposing the system to an environment with a lower temperature.\n\n[[Coolant]]s are [[fluid]]s used to cool objects, prevent freezing and prevent erosion in machines.<ref>{{cite web|title=An Introduction to Coolant Technology|url=http://www.coolantexperts.com/coolant_overview/|website=coolantexperts.com|accessdate=15 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160223043806/http://www.coolantexperts.com/coolant_overview|archivedate=23 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Air cooling]] is the process of cooling an object by exposing it to [[air]]. This will only work if the air is at a lower temperature than the object, and the process can be enhanced by increasing the [[surface area]] or decreasing the [[mass]] of the object.<ref>{{cite web|title=Air Cooling|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/2143/air-cooling|website=techopedia.com|accessdate=16 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302104201/https://www.techopedia.com/definition/2143/air-cooling|archivedate=2 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAnother common method of cooling is exposing an object to [[ice]], [[dry ice]], or [[liquid nitrogen]]. This works by [[convection]]; the [[heat]] is transferred from the relatively warm object to the relatively cold coolant.<ref>{{cite web|title=When you add energy to an object and the object warms, what exactly is happening inside the object?|url=http://www.atmo.arizona.edu/students/courselinks/spring13/atmo170a1s1/online_course/week_4/lect11_temperature_conduction_convection_latent_heat.html|website=atmo.arizona.edu|accessdate=16 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916012857/http://www.atmo.arizona.edu/students/courselinks/spring13/atmo170a1s1/online_course/week_4/lect11_temperature_conduction_convection_latent_heat.html|archivedate=16 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Laser cooling]] and [[magnetic evaporative cooling]] are techniques used to reach very low temperatures.<ref>{{cite web|title=Laser Cooling|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/optmod/lascool.html|website=hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu|accessdate=15 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131011327/http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/optmod/lascool.html|archivedate=31 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The basic idea of the evaporative cooling is simple.|url=http://cold-atoms.physics.lsa.umich.edu/projects/bec/evaporation.html|website=cold-atoms.physics.lsa.umich.edu|accessdate=15 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151209171752/http://cold-atoms.physics.lsa.umich.edu/projects/bec/evaporation.html|archivedate=9 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nIn ancient times, ice was not adopted for food preservation but used to cool wine which the Romans had also done. According to [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], [[Nero|Emperor Nero]] invented the ice bucket to chill wines instead of adding it to wine to make it cold as it would dilute it.{{Sfn|Shachtman|2000|p=17}}\n\nSome time around 1700 BC [[Zimri-Lim]], king of [[Mari, Syria|Mari Kingdom]] in northwest Iraq had created an \"icehouse\" called ''bit shurpin'' at a location close to his capital city on the banks of the [[Euphrates]]. In the 7th century BC the Chinese had used icehouses to preserve vegetables and fruits. During the [[Tang dynasty|Tang dynastic rule]] in China (618 -907 AD) a document refers to the practice of using ice that was in vogue during the [[Eastern Chou Dynasty]] (770 -256 BC) by 94 workmen employed for \"Ice-Service\" to freeze everything from wine to dead bodies.{{Sfn|Shachtman|2000|p=17}}\n\nShachtman says that in the 4th century AD, [[Emperor Nintoku|Nintoku]], Japanese Emperor was given a gift by his brother of ice from a mountain. The Emperor was so happy with the gift that he named the first of June as the \"Day of Ice\" and ceremoniously gave blocks of ice to his officials.{{Sfn|Shachtman|2000|p=17}}\n\nEven in ancient times, Shachtman says, in Egypt and India, night cooling by evaporation of water and heat radiation, and the ability of salts to lower the freezing temperature of water was practiced. The ancient people of Rome and Greece were aware that boiled water cooled quicker than the ordinary water; the reason for this is that with boiling of water [[carbon dioxide]] and other gases, which are deterrents to cooling, are removed; but this fact was not known till the 17th century.{{Sfn|Shachtman|2000|p=17}}\n\n===From the 17th century===\n{{Quote\n |quote = {{big|'''How cold'''}}\n<poem>\nWhen I woke up this morning\nit was very cold.\nHow cold was it?\nIt was a freezing, sneezing\ngoose-bumpy, teeth-chattering,\ncan't-get-out-of-bed,\nblankets-over-my-head\nkind of cold\n</poem>\n |author = Cold\n |source = {{Sfn|Barclay|Donato|1999|p=1}}\n}}\n\nAccording to [[Tom Shachtman]], till early seventeenth century cold was considered a mystery without source which was linked with death; inexplicable and too fearsome to investigate. Refrigeration by artificial means was an abhorrent idea as the thinking was for natural refrigeration though lot of consumable goods perished without any effort towards refrigeration. In the early 1700s nobody tried to improve the efficacy of health, transportation or communications by mastering the knowledge of cold nor was there any effort to improve the comfort level of people by proper adoption of cold. The reasons for conversion of [[snow]] in the heavens into water, on the earth, reason for formation of [[snowflake]]s, its slippery characteristics were not fathomed. Snow measurements were not known.{{Sfn|Shachtman|2000|p=2}}\n\nShachtman says it was [[Cornelis Jacobszoon Drebbel]] who was appointed in 1608 by James Stuart, King of England who believed in magicians to perform magical tricks such as to produce thunder lightning, lions, birds, trembling leaves and so forth. It was Drebbel, in 1620, who demonstrated an experiment in the Westminster Abbey to the king and his courtiers on the power of cold.{{Sfn|Shachtman|2000|p=4}} On a summer day, Shachtman says, Drebbel had created a chill (lowered the temperature by several degrees) in the hall of the Abbey which made the king to shiver and run out of the hall with his entourage. This was an incredible spectacle, says Shachtman. On an earlier occasion several years back Giambattista dells Porta had demonstrated at the Abbey \"ice fantasy gardens, intricate ice sculptures\" and also iced drinks for banquets in [[Florence]]. The only reference to the artificial freezing created by Drebbel was in a reference by [[Francis Bacon]]. His demonstration was not taken seriously as it was considered as one of his magic tricks, as there was no practical application then. Drebbel had not revealed his secrets.{{Sfn|Shachtman|2000|pp=8-9}}\n\nLord Chancellor Bacon, says Shachtman, who was advocating experimental science had in the publication ''Navum Organum'' published in the later part of 1620s had made an attempt to explain the artificial freezing experiment at Westminster Abbey, though he was not present during the demonstration, as \"Nitre (or rather its spirit) is very cold, and hence nitre or salt when added to snow or ice intensifies the cold of the latter, the nitre by adding to its own cold, but the salt by supplying activity to the cold snow.\" This explanation on the cold inducing aspects of nitre (now known as [[potassium nitrate]]) and salt was tried then by many scientists.{{Sfn|Shachtman|2000|pp=12-13}}\n\nShachtman says it was the lack of scientific knowledge in physics and chemistry that had held back progress in use of ice for beneficial purposes till the awakening came in the 17th century, brought about by a drastic change in societal transformation in religious thoughts. The intellectual barrier was broken by Francis Bacon and [[Robert Boyle]] who followed him in this quest for knowledge of cold.{{Sfn|Shachtman|2000|pp=18-25}} Boyle did extensive experimentation during the 17th century in the discipline of cold, and his research which related to pressure and volume, was the forerunner of research in the field of cold during the 19th century. He explained his approach as \"Bacon's identification of heat and cold as the right and left hands of nature\".{{Sfn|Shachtman|2000|pp=25-26}} Boyle also refuted some of the theories mooted by [[Aristotle]] on cold by experimenting on transmission of cold from one material to the other. He proved that water was the not the only source of cold but gold, silver and crystal, which had no water content, could also change to severe cold condition.{{Sfn|Shachtman|2000|p=28}}\n\n===19th century===\nIn the United States from about 1850 till end of 19th century export of ice was second only to cotton. The first ice box was developed by Thomas Moore, a farmer from [[Maryland]] in 1810 to carry butter in an oval shaped wooden tub. The tub was provided with a metal lining in its interior and surrounded by a packing of ice. A rabbit skin was used as insulation. Moore also developed an ice box for domestic use with the container built over a space of {{convert|6|cuft}} which was filled with ice. In 1825, ice harvesting by use of a horse drawn ice cutting device was invented by Nathaniel J. Wyeth. The cut blocks of uniform size ice was a cheap method of food preservation widely practiced in the United States. Also developed in 1855 was a steam powered device to haul 600 tons of ice per hour. More innovations ensued. Devices using compressed air as a refrigerants were invented.{{Sfn|Flynn|2004|p=23}}\n\n===20th century===\n[[Icebox]]es were in widespread use from the mid-19th century to the 1930s, when the [[refrigerator]] was introduced into the home. Most municipally consumed ice was harvested in winter from snow-packed areas or frozen lakes, stored in [[Icehouse (building)|ice houses]], and delivered domestically as iceboxes became more common.\n\nIn 1913, refrigerators for home use were invented. In 1923 Frigidaire introduced the first self-contained unit. The introduction of [[Freon]] in the 1920s expanded the refrigerator market during the 1930s.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Story of the Refrigerator|url=http://www.aham.org/consumer/ht/action/GetDocumentAction/id/1409|website=aham.org|publisher=Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers|accessdate=16 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305065925/http://www.aham.org/consumer/ht/action/getdocumentaction/id/1409|archivedate=5 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Home freezers as separate compartments (larger than necessary just for ice cubes) were introduced in 1940.

Treatment consists of any anti-inflammatory medicine (such as ipratropium)<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> to treat the inflammation, and a cough suppressant to reduce frequency of the cough until inflammation clears.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Inflammation may increase sensitivity to other existing issues such as [[allergies]], and treatment of other causes of coughs (such as use of an air purifier or allergy medicines) may help speed recovery. A bronchodilator, which helps open up the airways, may also help treat this type of cough.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n===Reactive airway disease===\nWhen coughing is the only complaint of a person who meets the criteria for asthma ([[bronchial hyperresponsiveness]] and reversibility), this is termed [[cough-variant asthma]]. Two related conditions are [[atopic cough]] and [[eosinophilic bronchitis]]. Atopic cough occurs in individuals with a [[family history]] of [[atopy]] (an allergic condition), abundant [[eosinophils]] in the sputum, but with normal airway function and responsiveness. Eosinophilic bronchitis is also characterized by [[eosinophils]] in the sputum, without airway hyperresponsiveness or an atopic background. This condition responds to treatment with [[corticosteroids]]. Cough can also worsen in an [[acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]].\n\nAsthma is a common cause of chronic cough in adults and children. Coughing may be the only symptom the person has from their asthma, or asthma symptoms may also include wheezing, shortness of breath, and a tight feeling in their chest. Depending on how severe the asthma is, it can be treated with bronchodilators (medicine which causes the airways to open up) or inhaled steroids. Treatment of the asthma should make the cough go away.\n\n[[Chronic bronchitis]] is defined clinically as a persistent cough that produces sputum (phlegm) and mucus, for at least three months in two consecutive years. Chronic bronchitis is often the cause of \"[[smoker's cough]]\". The tobacco smoke causes inflammation, secretion of mucus into the airway, and difficulty clearing that mucus out of the airways. Coughing helps clear those secretions out. May be treated by quitting smoking. May also be caused by [[pneumoconiosis]] and long-term fume inhalation.\n\n===Gastroesophageal reflux===\nIn people with unexplained cough, [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] should be considered.<ref name=Review10/> This occurs when acidic contents of the stomach come back up into the esophagus. Symptoms usually associated with [[GERD]] include heartburn, sour taste in the mouth, or a feeling of acid reflux in the chest, although, more than half of the people with cough from GERD don\u2019t have any other symptoms. An esophageal pH monitor can confirm the diagnosis of GERD. Sometimes GERD can complicate respiratory ailments related to cough, such as asthma or bronchitis. The treatment involves anti-acid medications and lifestyle changes with surgery indicated in cases not manageable with conservative measures.\n\n===Air pollution===\nCoughing may be caused by [[air pollution]] including [[tobacco smoke]], particulate matter, irritant gases, and dampness in a home.<ref name=Review10/>\nThe human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body's respiratory system and the cardiovascular system.  Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, the individual's health status and genetics.  People who exercise outdoors on hot, smoggy days, for example, increase their exposure to pollutants in the air.\n\n===Foreign body===\nA [[foreign body]] can sometimes be suspected, for example if the cough started suddenly when the patient was eating. Rarely, sutures left behind inside the airway branches can cause coughing. A cough can be triggered by dryness from [[mouth breathing]] or recurrent aspiration of food into the [[Vertebrate trachea|windpipe]] in people with [[dysphagia|swallowing difficulties]].\n\n===Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor===\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are drugs used in diabetics, heart disease, and high blood pressure. In 10-25%{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} of the people who take it, it can cause them to have a cough as a side effect. Cessation of ACE Inhibitor use is the only way to stop the cough. Such medicines for hypertension are very common in use such as [[ramipril]] and [[quinapril]]. There are cases of \"cough of unknown origin\" who had resolution with stopping the drug.<ref>Kostas Koliopoulos, Cardiologist: \"Cases of Cough of unknown origin, due to use of ACE medication for hypertension\", data on file, Preveza, Greece, 2010</ref>\n\n===Psychogenic cough===\nA [[psychogenic cough]], \"[[habit cough]]\" or \"tic cough\" may be the cause in the absence of a physical problem. In these instances, emotional and psychological problems are suspected. However, other illnesses have to be ruled out before a firm diagnosis of psychogenic cough is made.\n\nPsychogenic cough is thought to be more common in children than in adults. A possible scenario: psychogenic cough develops in a child who has a chronically ill brother or sister.<ref name=\"pmid16428707\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Irwin RS, Glomb WB, Chang AB |title=Habit cough, tic cough, and psychogenic cough in adult and pediatric populations: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines |journal=Chest |volume=129 |issue=1 Suppl |pages=174S\u2013179S |date=January 2006 |pmid=16428707 |doi=10.1378/chest.129.1_suppl.174S |url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16428707}}</ref>\n\n===Neurogenic cough===\nSome cases of chronic cough may be attributed to a sensory neuropathic disorder.<ref name=\"pmid21524236\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gibson PG, Ryan NM |title=Cough pharmacotherapy: current and future status |journal=Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy |volume=12 |issue=11 |pages=1745\u20131755 |date=August 2011 |pmid=21524236 |doi=10.1517/14656566.2011.576249 |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1517/14656566.2011.576249}}</ref> Treatment for neurogenic cough may include the use of certain neuralgia medications.  Coughing may occur in [[tic disorder]]s such as [[Tourette syndrome]], although it should be distinguished from throat-clearing in this disorder.\n\n===Other===\nCough may also be caused by conditions affecting the lung tissue such as [[bronchiectasis]], [[cystic fibrosis]], [[interstitial lung disease]]s and [[sarcoidosis]]. Coughing can also be triggered by [[benign]] or [[lung cancer|malignant lung tumor]]s or mediastinal masses. Through irritation of the nerve, diseases of the external auditory canal (wax, for example) can also cause cough. Cardiovascular diseases associated with cough are heart failure, pulmonary infarction and aortic aneurysm. Nocturnal cough is associated with heart failure, as the heart does not compensate for the increased volume shift to the pulmonary circulation, in turn causing [[pulmonary edema]] and resultant cough.<ref name=Farzan>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=cm&part=A1188 NCBI  \u00bb Bookshelf  \u00bb Clinical Methods  \u00bb The Pulmonary System \u00bb Cough and Sputum Production] By Sattar Farzan.

Capsaicin is what makes [[chili pepper]]s spicy, and might explain why workers in factories with these fruits can develop a cough.\n\nCoughing may also be used for social reasons, such as coughing before giving a [[Speech-making|speech]].  Coughing is not always involuntary, and can be used in social situations. Coughing can be used to attract attention, release internal psychological tension, or become a maladaptive displacement behavior. It is believed that the frequency of such coughing increases in environments vulnerable to psychological tension and social conflict. In such environments, coughing may become one of many [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]] behaviors or [[defense mechanism]]s.\n\n==Pathophysiology==\n[[Image:CoughsAndSneezesSpreadDiseases.jpg|thumb|Coughing is viewed as a public health issue.]]\nA cough is a protective [[reflex]] in healthy individuals which is influenced by [[psychological]] factors.<ref name=Review10/> The cough reflex is initiated by stimulation of two different classes of [[afferent nerve]]s, namely the [[myelin]]ated rapidly adapting receptors, and nonmyelinated [[Group C nerve fiber|C-fibers]] with endings in the [[lung]]s. However it is not certain that the stimulation of nonmyelinated [[Group C nerve fiber|C-fibers]] leads to cough with a [[reflex]] as it's meant in [[physiology]] (with its own five components): this stimulation may cause [[mast cell]]s [[degranulation]] (through an asso-assonic reflex) and [[edema]] which may work as a stimulus for rapidly adapting receptors.\n\n==Diagnostic approach==\nThe type of cough may help in the diagnosis. For instance, an inspiratory \"whooping\" sound on coughing almost doubles the likelihood that the illness is [[pertussis]]. \n\n[[Hemoptysis|Blood]] may occur in small amounts with severe cough of many causes, but larger amounts suggests [[bronchitis]], [[bronchiectasis]], [[tuberculosis]], or primary [[lung cancer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/pulmonary-disorders/symptoms-of-pulmonary-disorders/cough-in-adults|title=Cough in Adults|author=Noah Lechtzin|website=[[Merck Manuals]]|accessdate=2017-04-07}} Last full review/revision July 2016</ref>\n\nFurther workup may include labs, [[x-rays]], and [[spirometry]].<ref name=Review10/>\n\n===Classification===\nA cough can be classified by its duration, character, quality, and timing.<ref name=Review10/> The duration can be either [[Acute (medicine)|acute]] (of sudden onset) if it is present less than three weeks, [[subacute]] if it is present between three or eight weeks, and [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] when lasting longer than eight weeks.<ref name=Review10/> A cough can be non-productive (dry) or productive (when [[sputum]] is coughed up).

Cognitive activities \"may affect both sensory and affective experience or they may modify primarily the affective-motivational dimension. Thus, excitement in games or war appears to block both dimensions of pain, while suggestion and placebos may modulate the affective-motivational dimension and leave the sensory-discriminative dimension relatively undisturbed.\" (p.&nbsp;432) The paper ends with a call to action: \"Pain can be treated not only by trying to cut down the sensory input by anesthetic block, surgical intervention and the like, but also by influencing the motivational-affective and cognitive factors as well.\" (p.&nbsp;435)\n\n===Theory today===\n[[File:Schematic of cortical areas involved with pain processing and fMRI.jpg|thumb|right|Regions of the cerebral cortex associated with pain.]]\n[[Wilhelm Erb|Wilhelm Erb's]] (1874) \"intensive\" theory, that a pain signal can be generated by intense enough stimulation of ''any'' sensory receptor, has been soundly disproved. Some sensory fibers do not differentiate between noxious and non-noxious stimuli, while others, [[nociceptor]]s, respond only to noxious, high intensity stimuli. At the peripheral end of the nociceptor, noxious stimuli generate currents that, above a given threshold, send [[action potential|signals]] along the nerve fiber to the spinal cord. The \"specificity\" (whether it responds to thermal, chemical or mechanical features of its environment) of a nociceptor is determined by which [[ion channel]]s it expresses at its peripheral end.

In various contexts, the deliberate infliction of pain in the form of [[corporal punishment]] is used as retribution for an offence, or for the purpose of disciplining or reforming a wrongdoer, or to deter attitudes or behaviour deemed unacceptable. The [[Lingchi|slow slicing]], or death by a thousand cuts, was a form of execution in China reserved for crimes viewed as especially severe, such as high treason or patricide. In some cultures, extreme practices such as [[mortification of the flesh]] or painful [[rites of passage]] are highly regarded.

However, like infants, animals cannot answer questions about whether they feel pain; thus the defining criterion for pain in humans cannot be applied to them. Philosophers and scientists have responded to this difficulty in a variety of ways.  [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] for example argued that animals lack consciousness and therefore do not experience pain and suffering in the way that humans do.<ref name=nuffield45>Working party of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics (2005).

The symptoms can be related to an underlying cause or the anemia itself.\nMost commonly, people with anemia report feelings of [[weakness]] or [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], and sometimes poor concentration. They may also report [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]] on exertion.  In very severe anemia, the body may compensate for the lack of oxygen-carrying capability of the blood by increasing [[cardiac output]].  The patient may have symptoms related to this, such as [[palpitation]]s, [[angina]] (if pre-existing heart disease is present), intermittent [[claudication]] of the legs, and symptoms of [[heart failure]].\nOn examination, the signs exhibited may include [[pallor]] ([[pallor|pale]] [[skin]], lining [[mucosa]], [[conjunctiva]] and [[nail beds]]), but this is not a reliable sign.  There may be signs of specific causes of anemia, e.g., [[koilonychia]] (in iron deficiency), [[jaundice]] (when anemia results from abnormal break down of red blood cells&nbsp;\u2014 in hemolytic anemia), bone deformities (found in [[thalassemia]] major) or [[leg]] [[ulcers]] (seen in [[sickle-cell disease]]).\nIn severe anemia, there may be signs of a [[hyperdynamic circulation]]: [[tachycardia]] (a fast heart rate), [[bounding pulse]], [[Functional murmur|flow murmurs]], and [[cardiac]] [[ventricular hypertrophy]] (enlargement).  There may be signs of [[heart failure]].\n[[Pica (disorder)|Pica]], the consumption of non-food items such as ice, but also paper, wax, or grass, and even hair or dirt, may be a symptom of iron deficiency, although it occurs often in those who have normal levels of [[hemoglobin]].\nChronic anemia may result in behavioral disturbances in children as a direct result of impaired neurological development in infants, and reduced academic performance in children of school age. [[Restless legs syndrome]] is more common in those with [[iron-deficiency anemia]].<ref name=\"Einollahi\">{{cite journal|last1=Einollahi|first1=Behzad|title=Restless Leg Syndrome: A Neglected Diagnosis|journal=Nephro-Urology Monthly|date=5 September 2014|doi=10.5812/numonthly.22009| pmc=4318015 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4318015/}}</ref>\n\n", "\n[[File:Modified sickle cell 01.jpg|thumb|left|Figure shows normal red blood cells flowing freely in a blood vessel.

Several of these may interplay to cause anemia eventually. Indeed, the most common cause of anemia is blood loss, but this usually does not cause any lasting symptoms unless a relatively impaired RBC production develops, in turn most commonly by [[iron deficiency]].<ref>[http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/anemia/anemia_causes.html National Heart Lung and Blood Institute > What Causes Anemia?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611213520/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/anemia/anemia_causes.html |date=2010-06-11 }} Retrieved on June 9, 2010</ref> (See [[Iron deficiency anemia]])\n\n"], "Q18554982": ["", "ntestinal perforation]"], "Q474718": ["}} \n|  ICD9        = {{ICD9|780.8}}, {{ICD9|327}} \n}}\n'''Night sweats''', also known as '''nocturnal hyperhidrosis''', is the occurrence of [[hyperhidrosis|excessive sweating]] during [[sleep]].

A trigger of the fever, called a pyrogen, causes a release of [[prostaglandin E2]] (PGE2). PGE2 then in turn acts on the hypothalamus, which generates a systemic response back to the rest of the body, causing heat-creating effects to match a new temperature level.\n\nIn many respects, the hypothalamus works like a [[thermostat]].<ref name=Harrisons>{{cite book|authorlink=Anthony Fauci|author=Fauci, Anthony|title=[[Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine]]|edition=17|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=2008|isbn=978-0-07-146633-2|pages= 117\u2013121}}</ref>  When the set point is raised, the body increases its temperature through both active generation of heat and retention of heat. Peripheral [[vasoconstriction]] both reduces heat loss through the skin and causes the person to feel cold.  [[Norepinephrine]] increases [[thermogenesis]] in [[brown adipose tissue]], and [[acetylcholine]] stimulates muscle to raise [[Basal metabolic rate|metabolic rate]].<ref name=\"pmid25976513 \">{{cite journal | vauthors=Evans SS, Repasky EA, Fisher DT | title=Fever and the thermal regulation of immunity: the immune system feels the heat| journal= [[Nature Reviews Immunology]] | volume=15 | issue=6 | pages=335\u2013349 | year=2015 | doi= 10.1038/nri3843 | pmc=4786079 | PMID = 25976513 }}</ref> If these measures are insufficient to make the blood temperature in the brain match the new set point in the hypothalamus, then [[shivering]] begins in order to use muscle movements to produce more heat.  When the hypothalamic set point moves back to baseline either spontaneously or with medication, the reverse of these processes (vasodilation, end of shivering and nonshivering heat production) and sweating are used to cool the body to the new, lower setting.\n\nThis contrasts with [[hyperthermia]], in which the normal setting remains, and the body overheats through undesirable retention of excess heat or over-production of heat.<ref name=Harrisons />  Hyperthermia is usually the result of an excessively hot environment ([[heat stroke]]) or an adverse reaction to drugs.  Fever can be differentiated from hyperthermia by the circumstances surrounding it and its response to [[anti-pyretic]] medications.\n\n===Pyrogens===\nA pyrogen is a substance that induces fever. These can be either internal ([[endogenous]]) or external ([[exogenous]]) to the body. The bacterial substance [[lipopolysaccharide]] (LPS), present in the cell wall of [[gram-negative bacteria]],<ref name=\"pmid20452953 \">{{cite journal | vauthors=Silhavy TJ, Kahne D, Walker S | title=The bacterial cell envelope | journal= [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press|Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in biology]] | volume=2 | issue=5 | pages=a000414 | year=2010 | doi= 10.1101/cshperspect.a000414 | pmc=2857177  | PMID = 20452953  }}</ref> is an example of an exogenous pyrogen. Pyrogenicity can vary: In extreme examples, some bacterial pyrogens known as [[superantigens]] can cause rapid and dangerous fevers. [[Depyrogenation]] may be achieved through [[filtration]], [[distillation]], [[chromatography]], or inactivation.\n\n====Endogenous====\nIn essence, all endogenous pyrogens are [[cytokines]], molecules that are a part of the [[immune system]].  They are produced by activated [[immune cells]] and cause the increase in the thermoregulatory set point in the hypothalamus. Major endogenous pyrogens are [[interleukin 1]] (\u03b1 and \u03b2)<ref name=boron-58>Chapter 58 in:  {{cite book |author=Walter F.

Minor endogenous pyrogens include [[interleukin-8]], [[Lymphotoxin alpha|tumor necrosis factor-\u03b2]], [[macrophage inflammatory protein]]-\u03b1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-\u03b2 as well as [[interferon-\u03b1]], [[IFN-\u03b2|interferon-\u03b2]], and [[Interferon-gamma|interferon-\u03b3]].<ref name=boron-58/> [[Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1]] also acts as a pyrogen. It is mediated by [[interleukin 1]] (IL-1) release.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stefferl|first=Andreas|author2=Stephen J. Hopkins, Nancy J. Rothwell & Giamal N.

The cytokine factors then bind with [[endothelium|endothelial receptor]]s on vessel walls, or interact with local [[microglial cell]]s. When these cytokine factors bind, the [[arachidonic acid pathway]] is then activated.\n\n====Exogenous====\nOne model for the mechanism of fever caused by exogenous pyrogens includes [[Lipopolysaccharide|LPS]], which is a cell wall component of [[Gram-negative|gram-negative bacteria]]. An immunological protein called [[lipopolysaccharide-binding protein]] (LBP) binds to LPS. The LBP\u2013LPS complex then binds to the [[CD14]] receptor of a nearby [[macrophage]]. This binding results in the synthesis and release of various endogenous [[cytokine]] factors, such as interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and the tumor necrosis factor-alpha. In other words, exogenous factors cause release of endogenous factors, which, in turn, activate the arachidonic acid pathway.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=J|last2=Blatteis|first2=CM|title=Mechanisms of fever production and lysis: lessons from experimental LPS fever.|journal=Comprehensive Physiology|date=October 2014|volume=4|issue=4|pages=1563\u2013604|doi=10.1002/cphy.c130033|pmid=25428854}}</ref> The highly toxic [[metabolism]]-boosting supplement [[2,4-Dinitrophenol]] induces [[hyperthermia|high body temperature]] via the inhibition of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] production by [[mitochondria]], resulting in impairment of [[cellular respiration]].

This pathway (as it relates to fever), is mediated by the [[enzyme]]s [[phospholipase|phospholipase A2]] (PLA2), [[cyclooxygenase|cyclooxygenase-2]] (COX-2), and [[prostaglandin E2 synthase]]. These enzymes ultimately mediate the synthesis and release of PGE2.\n\nPGE2 is the ultimate mediator of the febrile response. The set point temperature of the body will remain elevated until PGE2 is no longer present. PGE2 acts on neurons in the [[preoptic area]] (POA) through the [[prostaglandin E receptor 3]] (EP3). EP3-expressing neurons in the POA innervate the [[dorsomedial hypothalamus]] (DMH), the rostral [[raphe]] pallidus nucleus in the [[medulla oblongata]] (rRPa), and the [[paraventricular nucleus]] (PVN) of the [[hypothalamus]] . Fever signals sent to the DMH and rRPa lead to stimulation of the [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] output system, which evokes non-shivering thermogenesis to produce body heat and skin vasoconstriction to decrease heat loss from the body surface. It is presumed that the innervation from the POA to the PVN mediates the neuroendocrine effects of fever through the pathway involving [[pituitary gland]] and various [[endocrine organs]].\n\n===Hypothalamus===\nThe brain ultimately orchestrates heat effector mechanisms via the [[autonomic nervous system]] or primary motor center for shivering. These may be:\n* Increased heat production by increased [[muscle tone]], [[shivering]] and hormones like [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline)\n* Prevention of heat loss, such as [[vasoconstriction]].\nIn infants, the autonomic nervous system may also activate [[brown adipose tissue]] to produce heat (non-exercise-associated [[thermogenesis]], also known as non-shivering thermogenesis). Increased heart rate and vasoconstriction contribute to increased [[blood pressure]] in fever.\n\n===Usefulness===\n\nThere are arguments for and against the usefulness of fever, and the issue is controversial.<ref name=\"Schaffner\">{{cite journal |last1= Schaffner|first1= A|title= Fever--useful or noxious symptom that should be treated?|journal= Therapeutische Umschau.

Based on Lundsgaard and Van Slyke's work,<ref>Lundsgaard C, Van Slyke DD. Cyanosis. Medicine. 2(1):1-76.</ref> it is classically described as occurring if 5.0&nbsp;g/dL of [[Hemoglobin#Deoxygenated hemoglobin|deoxyhemoglobin]] or greater is present.<ref>{{cite book |title=Mini Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine |edition=7th |page=56 }}</ref> This was based on an estimate of capillary saturation based on a mean of arterial versus peripheral venous blood gas measurements.<ref>Cyanosis. Lundsgaard C, Van SD, Abbott ME.  Cyanosis. Can Med Assoc J 1923 Aug;13(8):601-4.</ref> Since estimation of hypoxia is usually now based either on arterial blood gas measurement or pulse oximetry, this is probably an overestimate, with evidence that levels of 2.0&nbsp;g/dL of deoxyhemoglobin may reliably produce cyanosis.<ref>Goss GA, Hayes JA, Burdon JG. Deoxyhaemoglobin concentrations in the detection of central cyanosis. Thorax 1988 Mar;43(3):212\u201313.</ref> Since, however, the presence of cyanosis is dependent upon there being an absolute quantity of deoxyhemoglobin, the bluish color is more readily apparent in those with high hemoglobin counts than it is with those with [[anemia]]. Also, the bluer the color, the more difficult it is to detect on deeply pigmented skin. When signs of cyanosis first appear, such as on the lips or fingers, intervention should be made within 3\u20135 minutes because a severe [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] or severe circulatory failure may have induced the cyanosis.\n\nThe name ''cyanosis'' literally means ''the blue disease'' or ''the blue condition''. It is derived from the color [[cyan]], which comes from \u03ba\u03c5\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2, ''kyan\u00f3s'', the Greek word for ''blue''.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Mosby's Medical, Nursing & Allied Health Dictionary]] |series=Mosby-Year Book |year=1994 |page=425 |edition=4th}}</ref>\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Cyanotic neonate.jpg|thumb|A baby with a heart condition. Note purple nailbeds.]]\n[[File:Arterial thrombosis causing cyanosis.jpg|thumb|Acute [[arterial thrombosis]] of the right leg]]\nCyanosis is defined as a bluish discoloration, especially of the skin and mucous membranes, due to excessive concentration of deoxyhemoglobin in the blood caused by deoxygenation.\n\nCyanosis is divided into two main types: '''central''' (around the core, lips, and tongue) and '''peripheral''' (only the extremities or fingers).\n\n== Forms and causes ==\n\n=== Central cyanosis ===\nCentral cyanosis is often due to a circulatory or ventilatory problem that leads to poor blood [[Oxygenation (medical)|oxygenation]] in the lungs. It develops when arterial oxygen saturation drops below 85% or 75%.\n\nAcute cyanosis can be as a result of asphyxiation or choking, and is one of the definite signs that respiration is being blocked.\n\nCentral cyanosis may be due to the following causes:\n\n1. [[Central nervous system]] (impairing normal ventilation):\n* [[Intracranial hemorrhage]]\n* [[Drug overdose]] (e.g. [[heroin]])\n* [[Tonic\u2013clonic seizure]] (e.g. grand mal seizure)\n\n2. [[Respiratory system]]:\n* [[Pneumonia]]\n* [[Bronchiolitis]]\n* [[Bronchospasm]] (e.g. [[asthma]])\n* [[Pulmonary Hypertension|Pulmonary hypertension]]\n* [[Pulmonary embolism]]\n* [[Hypoventilation]]\n* [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], or COPD ([[emphysema]])\n3. [[Cardiovascular disease]]s: \n* [[Congenital heart disease]] (e.g. [[Tetralogy of Fallot]], [[Right-to-left shunt|right to left shunts in heart or great vessels]])\n* [[Heart failure]]\n* [[Valvular heart disease]]\n* [[Myocardial infarction]]\n\n4. [[Blood]]:\n* [[Methemoglobinemia]] * Note this causes \"spurious\" cyanosis, in that, since methemoglobin appears blue,<ref>[[Methemoglobin]]</ref> the patient can appear cyanosed even in the presence of a normal arterial oxygen level.\n* [[Polycythaemia]]\n* Congenital cyanosis (HbM Boston) arises from a [[mutation]] in the \u03b1-codon which results in a change of [[primary sequence]], H \u2192 Y. [[Tyrosine]] stabilises the Fe(III) form ([[oxyhaemoglobin]]) creating a permanent T-state of Hb.\n\n5. Others:\n* High [[altitude]], cyanosis may develop in ascents to altitudes >2400 m.\n* [[Hypothermia]]\n* [[Obstructive sleep apnea]]\n\n=== Peripheral cyanosis ===\n\nPeripheral cyanosis is the blue tint in fingers or extremities, due to an inadequate or obstructed circulation. The blood reaching the extremities is not oxygen-rich and when viewed through the skin a combination of factors can lead to the appearance of a [[Blood#Color|blue color]]. All factors contributing to central cyanosis can also cause peripheral symptoms to appear but peripheral cyanosis can be observed in the absence of heart or lung failures. Small blood vessels may be restricted and can be treated by increasing the normal oxygenation level of the blood.\n\nPeripheral cyanosis may be due to the following causes:\n* All common causes of central cyanosis\n* Reduced cardiac output (e.g. [[heart failure]] or [[hypovolaemia]])\n* Cold exposure\n* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n* Arterial obstruction (e.g. [[peripheral vascular disease]], [[Raynaud phenomenon]])\n* Venous obstruction (e.g. [[deep vein thrombosis]])\n\n=== Differential cyanosis ===\n\nDifferential cyanosis is the bluish coloration of the lower but not the upper extremity and the head. This is seen in patients with a patent [[ductus arteriosus]]. Patients with a large ductus develop progressive pulmonary vascular disease, and [[pressure overload]] of the right ventricle occurs. As soon as pulmonary pressure exceeds aortic pressure, shunt reversal (right-to-left shunt) occurs. The upper extremity remains pink because the brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid trunk and the left subclavian trunk is given off proximal to the PDA.\n\n== Approach to diagnosis ==\n{{howto|date=May 2016}}\n* Inquire about duration (cyanosis since birth suggests congenital heart disease) and exposures .\n* Differentiate central from peripheral cyanosis.\n* Check for [[nail clubbing]]: Combination of clubbing and cyanosis suggests congenital heart disease and occasionally pulmonary disease.\n* If cyanosis is localized to an extremity, evaluate for peripheral vascular obstruction.\n* Evaluate abnormal hemoglobins by hemoglobin electrophoresis, spectroscopy and measurement of methemoglobin level.<ref name=hmim>{{cite book|last=Anthony S.

Based on Lundsgaard and Van Slyke's work,<ref>Lundsgaard C, Van Slyke DD. Cyanosis. Medicine. 2(1):1-76.</ref> it is classically described as occurring if 5.0&nbsp;g/dL of [[Hemoglobin#Deoxygenated hemoglobin|deoxyhemoglobin]] or greater is present.<ref>{{cite book |title=Mini Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine |edition=7th |page=56 }}</ref> This was based on an estimate of capillary saturation based on a mean of arterial versus peripheral venous blood gas measurements.<ref>Cyanosis. Lundsgaard C, Van SD, Abbott ME.  Cyanosis. Can Med Assoc J 1923 Aug;13(8):601-4.</ref> Since estimation of hypoxia is usually now based either on arterial blood gas measurement or pulse oximetry, this is probably an overestimate, with evidence that levels of 2.0&nbsp;g/dL of deoxyhemoglobin may reliably produce cyanosis.<ref>Goss GA, Hayes JA, Burdon JG. Deoxyhaemoglobin concentrations in the detection of central cyanosis. Thorax 1988 Mar;43(3):212\u201313.</ref> Since, however, the presence of cyanosis is dependent upon there being an absolute quantity of deoxyhemoglobin, the bluish color is more readily apparent in those with high hemoglobin counts than it is with those with [[anemia]]. Also, the bluer the color, the more difficult it is to detect on deeply pigmented skin. When signs of cyanosis first appear, such as on the lips or fingers, intervention should be made within 3\u20135 minutes because a severe [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] or severe circulatory failure may have induced the cyanosis.\n\nThe name ''cyanosis'' literally means ''the blue disease'' or ''the blue condition''. It is derived from the color [[cyan]], which comes from \u03ba\u03c5\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2, ''kyan\u00f3s'', the Greek word for ''blue''.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Mosby's Medical, Nursing & Allied Health Dictionary]] |series=Mosby-Year Book |year=1994 |page=425 |edition=4th}}</ref>\n\n"], "Q167844": ["}}\n{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n| name            = Conjunctivitis\n| image           = An eye with viral conjunctivitis.jpg\n| caption         = An eye with viral conjunctivitis\n| field           = [[Ophthalmology]]\n| synonyms        = Pink eye\n| symptoms        = [[Reddish eye]], scratchiness<ref name=NIH2015/>\n| complications   = \n| onset           = \n| duration        = \n| causes          = [[viral infection|Viral]], [[bacterial infection|bacterial]], allergies<ref name=Az2013/>\n| risks           = \n| diagnosis       = Based on symptoms, [[microbial culture]]<ref name=NIH2015/>\n| differential    = \n| prevention      = [[Handwashing]]<ref name=NIH2015/>\n| treatment       = Based on underlying cause<ref name=Az2013/>\n| medication      = \n| prognosis       = \n| frequency       = 3\u20136 million per year (USA)<ref name=NIH2015/><ref name=Az2013/>\n| deaths          = \n}}\n<!-- Definition and symptoms -->\n'''Conjunctivitis''', also known as '''pink eye''', is [[inflammation]] of the [[conjunctiva|outermost layer of the white part of the eye]] and the inner surface of the [[eyelid]].<ref name=Peads10>{{cite journal |vauthors=Richards A, Guzman-Cottrill JA |title=Conjunctivitis |journal=Pediatr Rev |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=196\u2013208 |date=May 2010 |pmid=20435711 |doi=10.1542/pir.31-5-196 |url=}}</ref> It makes the eye appear pink or reddish.<ref name=NIH2015/> There may also be pain, burning, scratchiness, or itchiness.<ref name=NIH2015/> The affected eye may have increased tears or be \"stuck shut\" in the morning.<ref name=NIH2015/> Swelling of the white part of the eye may also occur.<ref name=NIH2015/> Itching of the eye is more common in cases due to allergies.<ref name=Az2013/> Conjunctivitis can affect one or both eyes.<ref name=NIH2015/>\n\n<!-- Causes and diagnosis -->\nThe most common infectious causes are [[viral infection|viral]] followed by [[bacterial infection|bacterial]].<ref name=Az2013>{{cite journal|last1=Azari|first1=AA|last2=Barney|first2=NP|title=Conjunctivitis: a systematic review of diagnosis and treatment.|journal=JAMA|date=23 October 2013|volume=310|issue=16|pages=1721\u20139|pmid=24150468|doi=10.1001/jama.2013.280318|pmc=4049531}}</ref> The viral infection may occur along with other symptoms of a [[common cold]].<ref name=NIH2015/> Viral and bacterial cases are easily spread between people.<ref name=NIH2015/> Allergies to [[pollen]] or animal hair is also a common cause.<ref name=Az2013/> Diagnosis is often based on signs and symptoms.<ref name=NIH2015/> Occasionally a sample of the discharge is sent for [[microbial culture|culture]].<ref name=NIH2015/>\n\n<!-- Prevention and treatment -->\nPrevention is partly by [[handwashing]].<ref name=NIH2015/> Treatment depends on the underlying cause.<ref name=NIH2015>{{cite web|title=Facts About Pink Eye|url=https://nei.nih.gov/health/pinkeye/pink_facts|website=National Eye Institute|accessdate=8 March 2016|date=November 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309104846/https://nei.nih.gov/health/pinkeye/pink_facts|archivedate=9 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the majority of viral cases, there is no specific treatment.<ref name=Az2013/> Most cases due to a bacterial infection will also resolve without treatment; however, [[antibiotic]]s can shorten the illness.<ref name=NIH2015/><ref name=Az2013/> Those who wear [[contact lens]] and those with either [[gonorrhea]] or [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] as the cause should be treated.<ref name=Az2013/> Allergic cases can be treated with [[antihistamine]] or [[mast cell inhibitor]] drops.<ref name=Az2013/>\n\n<!-- Epidemiology and prognosis -->\nAbout 3 to 6 million people get conjunctivitis each year in the United States.<ref name=NIH2015/><ref name=Az2013/> In adults viral causes are more common, while in children bacterial causes are more common.<ref name=Az2013/> Typically people get better in one or two weeks.<ref name=NIH2015/><ref name=Az2013/> If there is [[visual loss]], significant pain, [[photophobia|sensitivity to light]], signs of [[herpes]], or a person is not improving after a week, further diagnosis and treatment may be required.<ref name=Az2013/> Conjunctivitis in a newborn, known as [[neonatal conjunctivitis]], may also require specific treatment.<ref name=NIH2015/>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\n[[Red eye (medicine)|Red eye]], [[chemosis|swelling of conjunctiva]]  and [[epiphora (medical)|watering]] of the eyes are symptoms common to all forms of conjunctivitis.

Its symptoms include excessive watering and itching. The infection usually begins with one eye, but may spread easily to the other.\n\nViral conjunctivitis shows a fine, diffuse pinkness of the [[conjunctiva]], which is easily mistaken for the [[Ciliary body|ciliary]] infection of iris ([[iritis]]), but there are usually corroborative signs on [[microscopy]], particularly numerous [[Lymph follicle|lymphoid follicle]]s on the [[Tarsus (eyelids)|tarsal]] conjunctiva, and sometimes a [[punctate keratitis]].\n\n===Allergic===\n[[File:Allergicconjunctivitis.jpg|thumb|right|An eye with [[allergic conjunctivitis]] showing conjunctival edema]]\n\n[[Allergic conjunctivitis]] is [[Allergic Inflammation|inflammation]] of the [[conjunctiva]] due to [[allergy]].<ref name=\"Bielory\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Bielory L, Friedlaender MH | title = Allergic conjunctivitis | journal = Immunol Allergy Clin North Am | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 43\u201358, vi |date=February 2008 | pmid = 18282545 | doi = 10.1016/j.iac.2007.12.005 }}</ref> [[Allergen]]s differ among patients.\n\nSymptoms consist of redness (mainly due to [[vasodilation]] of the peripheral small [[blood vessel]]s), [[edema|swelling]] of the conjunctiva, [[itch]]ing, and increased [[lacrimation]] (production of [[tears]]). If this is combined with [[rhinitis]], the condition is termed \"allergic rhinoconjunctivitis\". The symptoms are due to release of [[histamine]] and other active substances by [[mast cell]]s, which stimulate dilation of blood vessels, irritate [[nerve ending]]s, and increase secretion of tears.\n\n===Bacterial===\n\n[[File:Swollen eye with conjunctivitis.jpg|thumb|right|An eye with bacterial conjunctivitis]]\nBacterial conjunctivitis causes the rapid onset of conjunctival [[hyperemia|redness]], swelling of the [[Tarsus (eyelids)|eyelid]], and [[mucopurulent discharge]].  Typically, symptoms develop first in one eye, but may spread to the other eye within 2\u20135 days.  Bacterial conjunctivitis due to common [[pyogenic]] (pus-producing) [[bacteria]] causes marked grittiness/irritation and a stringy, opaque, greyish or yellowish [[mucopurulent discharge]] that may cause the lids to stick together, especially after sleep.  Severe crusting of the infected eye and the surrounding skin may also occur.  The gritty and/or scratchy feeling is sometimes localized enough for patients to insist they must have a foreign body in the eye.

Rarer causes include [[hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia]] (HHT or Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome), [[Goodpasture's syndrome]], and [[granulomatosis with polyangiitis]]. In children, hemoptysis is commonly caused by the presence of a [[foreign body]] in the [[respiratory tract|airway]]. The condition can also result from over-anticoagulation from treatment by drugs such as [[warfarin]].\n\nBlood-laced mucus from the sinus or nose area can sometimes be misidentified as symptomatic of hemoptysis (such secretions can be a sign of nasal or [[sinus cancer]], but also a [[sinus infection]]). Extensive non-respiratory injury can also cause one to cough up blood.  Cardiac causes like [[congestive heart failure]] and [[mitral stenosis]] should be ruled out.\n\nThe origin of blood can be identified by observing its color. Bright-red, foamy blood comes from the respiratory tract, whereas dark-red, coffee-colored blood comes from the [[gastrointestinal tract]].

}}</ref>\n\n===Secretory===\nSecretory diarrhea means that there is an increase in the active secretion, or there is an inhibition of absorption. There is little to no structural damage. The most common cause of this type of diarrhea is a [[cholera toxin]] that stimulates the secretion of [[anion]]s, especially [[chloride]] ions. Therefore, to maintain a charge balance in the [[gastrointestinal tract]], sodium is carried with it, along with water. In this type of diarrhea intestinal fluid secretion is [[Tonicity#3|isotonic]] with plasma even during fasting.<ref name=\"webmd.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-diarrhea |title=The Basics of Diarrhea |publisher=Webmd.com |date=17 February 2011 |accessdate=9 March 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311010926/http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-diarrhea |archivedate=11 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"MoonZhang2015\"/> It continues even when there is no oral food intake.\n\n===Osmotic===\nOsmotic diarrhea occurs when too much water is drawn into the bowels.

Or it can be caused by osmotic [[laxatives]] (which work to alleviate [[constipation]] by drawing water into the bowels). In healthy individuals, too much [[magnesium]] or [[vitamin C]] or undigested [[lactose]] can produce osmotic diarrhea and distention of the bowel. A person who has [[lactose intolerance]] can have difficulty absorbing lactose after an extraordinarily high intake of dairy products. In persons who have [[fructose malabsorption]], excess fructose intake can also cause diarrhea. High-fructose foods that also have a high glucose content are more absorbable and less likely to cause diarrhea. Sugar alcohols such as sorbitol (often found in sugar-free foods) are difficult for the body to absorb and, in large amounts, may lead to osmotic diarrhea.<ref name=\"webmd.com\"/> In most of these cases, osmotic diarrhea stops when the offending agent (e.g. milk, sorbitol) is stopped.\n\n===Exudative===\nExudative diarrhea occurs with the presence of blood and pus in the stool. This occurs with [[inflammatory bowel diseases]], such as [[Crohn's disease]] or [[ulcerative colitis]], and other severe infections such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' or other forms of food poisoning.<ref name=\"MoonZhang2015\"/><ref name=\"webmd.com\"/>\n\n===Inflammatory===\nInflammatory diarrhea occurs when there is damage to the mucosal lining or brush border, which leads to a passive loss of protein-rich fluids and a decreased ability to absorb these lost fluids. Features of all three of the other types of diarrhea{{clarify|date=August 2013}} can be found in this type of diarrhea. It can be caused by bacterial infections, viral infections, parasitic infections, or autoimmune problems such as inflammatory bowel diseases. It can also be caused by tuberculosis, colon cancer, and enteritis.<ref name=\"MoonZhang2015\"/>\n\n===Dysentery===\nIf there is blood visible in the stools, it is also known as [[dysentery]].

Clinicians try to treat the diarrheas by reducing the dosage of medication, changing the dosing schedule, discontinuation of the drug, and rehydration.

The first, [[respiratory sinus arrhythmia]], is usually found in young and healthy adults. Heart rate increases during inhalation and decreases during exhalation.  This is thought to be caused by changes in the [[vagal]] tone during respiration.<ref name=HN>{{cite book|title=Harwood-Nuss' Clinical Practice of Emergency Medicine|editor=Allan B.

This usually appears on an [[EKG]] with a normal [[QRS complex]] accompanied with an inverted P wave either before, during, or after the QRS complex.<ref name=HN/>\n\nAn AV junctional escape is a delayed heartbeat originating from an [[Ectopic beat|ectopic]] focus somewhere in the [[AV junction]]. It occurs when the rate of [[depolarization]] of the SA node falls below the rate of the AV node.<ref name=HN/> This [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|dysrhythmia]] also may occur when the electrical impulses from the SA node fail to reach the AV node because of SA or AV block.<ref name=AHA>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=746|title=AV Junctional Rhythm Disturbances (for Professionals)|date=4 December 2008|publisher=American Heart Association|accessdate=15 December 2009}}</ref> This is a protective mechanism for the heart, to compensate for an SA node that is no longer handling the pacemaking activity, and is one of a series of backup sites that can take over pacemaker function when the SA node fails to do so.

Premature babies are more likely than full-term babies to have apnea and bradycardia spells; their cause is not clearly understood. The spells may be related to centers inside the brain that regulate breathing which may not be fully developed. Touching the baby gently or rocking the incubator slightly will almost always get the baby to start breathing again, which increases the heart rate. Medications ([[theophylline]] or [[caffeine]]) can be used to treat these spells in babies if necessary. [[Neonatal intensive-care unit]] (NICU) standard practice is to electronically monitor the heart and lungs for this reason.\n\n", "\nThis [[cardiac arrhythmia]] can be underlain by several causes, which are best divided into cardiac and noncardiac causes.\nNoncardiac causes are usually secondary, and can involve [[recreational drug use]] or [[drug abuse|abuse]]; [[metabolism|metabolic]] or [[endocrine]] issues, especially in the [[hypothyroidism|thyroid]]; an [[electrolyte]] imbalance; [[:Category:Neurology|neurologic]] factors; [[autonomic reflex]]es; situational factors such as prolonged [[bed rest]]; and [[autoimmune|autoimmunity]].\nCardiac causes include acute or chronic [[ischemic heart disease]], vascular [[heart disease]], valvular heart disease, or degenerative primary electrical disease. Ultimately, the causes act by three mechanisms: depressed [[automaticity]] of the heart, conduction block, or escape pacemakers and rhythms.\n\nIn general, two types of problems result in bradycardias: disorders of the [[sinoatrial node]] (SA node), and disorders of the [[atrioventricular node]] (AV node).\n\nWith sinus node dysfunction (sometimes called [[sick sinus syndrome]]), there may be disordered [[automaticity]] or impaired conduction of the impulse from the sinus node into the surrounding atrial tissue (an \"exit block\"). Second-degree sinoatrial blocks can be detected only by use of a 12-lead EKG.<ref name=NCBI>{{cite journal|pmid=16308110|title=Bradydysrhythmias and atrioventricular conduction blocks|last=Ufberg |first=JW |last2=Clark |first2=JS|date=February 2006|doi=10.1016/j.emc.2005.08.006|volume=24|issue=1|journal=Emerg.

The clinical relevance pertaining to AV blocks is greater than that of sinoatrial blocks.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nPatients with bradycardia have likely acquired it, as opposed to having it [[congenital]]ly. Bradycardia is more common in older patients.\n\nBeta-blocker medicines also can slow the heart rate and decrease how forcefully the heart contracts.

The presence of scleral icterus indicates a serum bilirubin of at least 3&nbsp;mg/dL.\nThe conjunctiva of the eye are one of the first [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] to change color as bilirubin levels rise in jaundice.

However, the sclera themselves are not \"icteric\" (stained with [[Bilin (biochemistry)|bile pigment]]) but rather the conjunctival membranes that overlie them. The yellowing of the \"white of the eye\" is thus more properly termed ''conjunctival icterus''.

Often tumor cells secrete growth factors which activate receptors close to primary afferent neurons. Activation of these neural receptors is a contributing factor to pain sensation. Additionally, inflammatory lipids called [[prostaglandin]]s, which are produced at high rates by cancer cells within tumors, activate nociceptors when they bind together.<ref name=mechanismcancer/>\n\n== Pathophysiology ==\nStimulation of specialized pain-sensitive nerve fibers ([[nociceptor]]s) that innervate bone tissue leads to the sensation of bone pain. Bone pain originates from both the periosteum and the bone marrow which relay [[Pain#Nociceptive|nociceptive]] signals to the brain creating the sensation of pain.

Weight loss can either occur unintentionally due to malnourishment or an underlying disease or arise from a conscious effort to improve an actual or perceived [[overweight]] or [[obese]] state.  \"Unexplained\" weight loss that is not caused by reduction in calorific intake or exercise is called [[cachexia]] and may be a symptom of a serious [[medical condition]]. [[#Intentional|Intentional weight loss]] is commonly referred to as '''slimming'''.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Intentional ==\nIntentional weight loss is the loss of total body mass as a result of efforts to improve [[physical fitness|fitness]] and health, or to change [[Human physical appearance|appearance]] through slimming.

It will then use stored reserves from fat or muscle, gradually leading to weight loss. For athletes seeking to improve performance or to meet required weight classification for participation in a sport, it is not uncommon to seek additional weight loss even if they are already at their [[ideal body weight]].  Others may be driven to lose weight to achieve an appearance they consider more attractive. However, being [[underweight]] is associated with health risks such as difficulty fighting off infection, [[osteoporosis]], decreased muscle strength, trouble regulating body temperature and even increased risk of death.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/news2005-mchi/2796.html |publisher=Mayo Clinic |title=Being underweight poses health risks |accessdate=13 January 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304150801/http://www.mayoclinic.org/news2005-mchi/2796.html  |archivedate = 4 March 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[Low-calorie diet]]s are also referred to as balanced percentage diets. Due to their minimal detrimental effects, these types of diets are most commonly recommended by nutritionists. In addition to restricting calorie intake, a balanced diet also regulates [[Macronutrients|macronutrient]] consumption. From the total number of allotted daily calories, it is recommended that 55% should come from [[carbohydrates]], 15% from [[protein]], and 30% from fats with no more than 10% of total fat coming from saturated forms.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} For instance, a recommended 1,200 calorie diet would supply about 660 calories from carbohydrates, 180 from protein, and 360 from fat. Some studies suggest that increased consumption of protein can help ease hunger pangs associated with reduced caloric intake by increasing the feeling of satiety.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/diet/guide/high-protein-diet-weight-loss|title=High-Protein Diet for Weight Loss|publisher=WebMD}}</ref> [[Calorie restriction]] in this way has many long-term benefits. After reaching the desired body weight, the calories consumed per day may be increased gradually, without exceeding 2,000 net (i.e. derived by subtracting calories burned by physical activity from calories consumed). Combined with increased physical activity, low-calorie diets are thought to be most effective long-term, unlike [[crash diets]], which can achieve short-term results, at best. Physical activity could greatly enhance the efficiency of a diet. The healthiest weight loss regimen, therefore, is one that consists of a balanced diet and moderate physical activity. {{Citation needed|date=May 2013|reason=for this paragraph}}\n\nWeight gain has been associated with excessive consumption of [[fat]]s, ([[Added sugar|added]]) [[sugar]]s, [[refined sugar|refined]] [[carbohydrates]] in general, and [[alcohol consumption]].{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} Depression, [[Stress (biology)|stress]] or [[boredom]] may also contribute to weight increase,{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} and in these cases, individuals are advised to seek medical help.

Shivering also occurs along with chills because the patient's body produces heat during muscle contraction in a physiological attempt to increase body temperature to the new set point.

Cluster headaches can be treated with triptans and prevented with prednisone, ergotamine or lithium.\n* [[trigeminal neuralgia]] or [[occipital neuralgia]]: shooting face pain\n* [[hemicrania continua]]: continuous unilateral pain with episodes of severe pain. Hemicrania continua can be relieved by the medication indomethacin.\n* primary stabbing headache: recurrent episodes of stabbing \"ice pick pain\" or \"jabs and jolts\" for 1 second to several minutes without autonomic symptoms (tearing, red eye, nasal congestion). These headaches can be treated with [[indomethacin]].\n* primary cough headache: starts suddenly and lasts for several minutes after coughing, sneezing or straining (anything that may increase pressure in the head). Serious causes (see secondary headaches red flag section) must be ruled out before a diagnosis of \"benign\" primary cough headache can be made.\n* primary exertional headache: throbbing, pulsatile pain which starts during or after exercising, lasting for 5 minutes to 24 hours. The mechanism behind these headaches is unclear, possibly due to straining causing veins in the head to dilate, causing pain. These headaches can be prevented by not exercising too strenuously and can be treated with medications such as [[indomethacin]].\n* [[Sexual headache|primary sex headache]]: dull, bilateral headache that starts during sexual activity and becomes much worse during orgasm. These headaches are thought to be due to lower pressure in the head during sex. It is important to realize that headaches that begin during orgasm may be due to a subarachnoid hemorrhage, so serious causes must be ruled out first. These headaches are treated by advising the person to stop sex if they develop a headache. Medications such as [[propranolol]] and [[diltiazem]] can also be helpful.\n* [[hypnic headache]]: moderate-severe headache that starts a few hours after falling asleep and lasts 15\u201330 minutes. The headache may recur several times during night. Hypnic headaches are usually in older women. They may be treated with [[lithium (medication)|lithium]].\n\n=== Secondary headaches ===\nHeadaches may be caused by problems elsewhere in the head or neck. Some of these are not harmful, such as [[cervicogenic headache]] (pain arising from the neck muscles). [[Medication overuse headache]] may occur in those using excessive painkillers for headaches, paradoxically causing worsening headaches.<ref name=SIGN />\n\nMore serious causes of secondary headaches include:<ref name=\"Goadsby\" />\n* [[meningitis]]: [[inflammation]] of the meninges which presents with fever and meningismus, or stiff neck\n* bleeding inside the brain ([[intracranial hemorrhage]])\n* [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]] (acute, severe headache, stiff neck WITHOUT fever)\n* [[ruptured aneurysm]], [[arteriovenous malformation]], [[intraparenchymal hemorrhage]] (headache only)\n* [[brain tumor]]: dull headache, worse with exertion and change in position, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Often, the person will have nausea and vomiting for weeks before the headache starts.\n* [[temporal arteritis]]: inflammatory disease of arteries common in the elderly (average age 70) with fever, headache, weight loss, jaw claudication, tender vessels by the temples, polymyalgia rheumatica\n* [[Glaucoma|acute closed angle glaucoma]] (increased pressure in the eyeball): headache that starts with eye pain, blurry vision, associated with nausea and vomiting.

Migraines may also not have auras.<ref name=Hainer /> Tension type headaches usually have bilateral \"bandlike\" pressure on both sides of the head usually without nausea or vomiting.

If 3 characteristics of POUND are present, migraine is 3 times more likely a diagnosis than tension type headache ([[Likelihood ratios in diagnostic testing|likelihood ratio]] 3).<ref name=Detsky /> If only 2 POUND characteristics are present, tension type headaches are 60% more likely (likelihood ratio 0.41).

It contains explicit (operational) [[diagnostic criteria]] for headache disorders. The first version of the classification, ICHD-1, was published in 1988. The current revision, ICHD-2, was published in 2004.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Headaches |edition=3 |publisher=[[Lippincott Williams & Wilkins]] |year=2005 |isbn=0-7817-5400-3 |first1=Jes |last1=Olesen |first2=Peter J. |last2=Goadsby |first3=Nabih M. |last3=Ramadan |first4=Peer |last4=Tfelt-Hansen |first5=K. Michael A. |last5=Welch |ref={{Harvid|Olesen et al.|2005}}}}</ref>\n\nThe classification uses numeric codes. The top, one-digit diagnostic level includes 14 headache groups. The first four of these are classified as primary headaches, groups 5-12 as secondary headaches, [[Human cranium|cranial]] [[neuralgia]], central and primary facial pain and other headaches for the last two groups.<ref>{{cite book |title=Comprehensive Review of Headache Medicine |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2008| isbn=0-19-536673-5 |first1=Morris |last1=Levin |first2=Steven M. |last2=Baskin |first3=Marcelo E. |last3=Bigal |ref={{Harvid|Levin et al.|2008}}}}</ref>\n\nThe ICHD-2 classification defines [[migraine]]s, tension-types headaches, cluster headache and other [[trigeminal]] autonomic headache as the main types of primary headaches.<ref name=\"IHS_ICHD2\" /> Also, according to the same classification, stabbing headaches and headaches due to [[cough]], exertion and sexual activity ([[sexual headache]]) are classified as primary headaches. The daily-persistent headaches along with the hypnic headache and thunderclap headaches are considered primary headaches as well.\n\nSecondary headaches are classified based on their cause and not on their [[symptoms]].<ref name=\"IHS_ICHD2\" /> According to the ICHD-2 classification, the main types of secondary headaches include those that are due to head or neck trauma such as [[Whiplash (medicine)|whiplash injury]], [[intracranial hematoma]], post [[craniotomy]] or other head or neck injury. Headaches caused by cranial or cervical vascular disorders such as [[Stroke#Ischemic stroke|ischemic stroke]] and [[transient ischemic attack]], non-traumatic intracranial hemorrhage, [[Cerebral arteriovenous malformation|vascular malformations]] or [[arteritis]] are also defined as secondary headaches. This type of headaches may also be caused by [[cerebral venous thrombosis]] or different intracranial vascular disorders. Other secondary headaches are those due to intracranial disorders that are not vascular such as low or high pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid pressure, non-infectious inflammatory disease, intracranial neoplasm, [[epileptic seizure]] or other types of disorders or diseases that are intracranial but that are not associated with the vasculature of the [[central nervous system]]. ICHD-2 classifies headaches that are caused by the ingestion of a certain substance or by its withdrawal as secondary headaches as well. This type of headache may result from the overuse of some medications or by exposure to some substances. [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], intracranial [[infections]] and systemic infections may also cause secondary headaches. The ICHD-2 system of classification includes the headaches associated with homeostasis disorders in the category of secondary headaches. This means that headaches caused by [[dialysis]], [[high blood pressure]], [[hypothyroidism]], and cephalalgia and even [[fasting]] are considered secondary headaches. Secondary headaches, according to the same classification system, can also be due to the injury of any of the facial structures including [[teeth]], jaws, or [[temporomandibular joint]]. Headaches caused by psychiatric disorders such as [[somatization]] or [[psychotic disorders]] are also classified as secondary headaches.\n\nThe ICHD-2 classification puts cranial neuralgias and other types of [[neuralgia]] in a different category. According to this system, there are 19 types of neuralgias and headaches due to different central causes of facial pain. Moreover, the ICHD-2 includes a category that contains all the headaches that cannot be classified.\n\nAlthough the ICHD-2 is the most complete headache classification there is and it includes frequency in the diagnostic criteria of some types of headaches (primarily primary headaches), it does not specifically code frequency or severity which are left at the discretion of the examiner.<ref name=\"IHS_ICHD2\" />\n\n==== NIH ====\n{{Main|NIH classification of headaches}}\nThe NIH classification consists of brief definitions of a limited number of headaches.{{sfn|Levin et al.|2008|page=60}}\n\nThe NIH system of classification is more succinct and only describes five categories of headaches. In this case, primary headaches are those that do not show organic or structural cause. According to this classification, headaches can only be vascular, [[myogenic]], cervicogenic, traction and inflammatory.\n\n== Management ==\n[[File:Image-Lottie Collins sings and dances to the tunes of Ta-Ra-Ra Boom-de-ay in a Bromo-Seltzer ad.jpg|thumb|An old advertisement for a headache medicine.]]\n{{See also|Management of chronic headaches}}\nPrimary headache syndromes have many different possible treatments.

(Accessed on April 24, 2014).</ref> Possible therapies include beta blockers, antidepressants, anticonvulsants and NSAIDs.<ref name=\"UTD Migraine Tx\" /> The type of preventive medicine is usually chosen based on the other symptoms the person has. For example, if the person also has depression, an antidepressant is a good choice.\n\nAbortive therapies for migraines may be oral, if the migraine is mild to moderate, or may require stronger medicine given intravenously or intramuscularly. Mild to moderate headaches should first be treated with [[acetaminophen]] (paracetamol) or NSAIDs, like [[ibuprofen]]. If accompanied by nausea or vomiting, an antiemitic such as metoclopramide (Reglan) can be given orally or rectally. Moderate to severe attacks should be treated first with an oral [[triptans|triptan]], a medication which mimics serotonin (an agonist) and causes mild vasoconstriction. If accompanied by nausea and vomiting, parenteral (through a needle in the skin) triptans and antiemetics can be given.\n\nSeveral complementary and alternative strategies can help with migraines. The American Academy of Neurology guidelines for migraine treatment in 2000 stated [[relaxation training]], electromyographic feedback and [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] may be considered for migraine treatment, along with medications.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Silberstein SD | year = 2000 | title = Practice parameter: evidence-based guidelines for migraine headache (an evidence-based review): report of the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology | url = | journal = Neurology | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 754\u201362 | doi=10.1212/wnl.55.6.754 | pmid=10993991}}</ref>\n\n=== Tension-type headaches ===\n[[Tension-type headache]]s can usually be managed with [[NSAIDs]] ([[ibuprofen]], [[naproxen]], [[aspirin]]), or [[acetaminophen]].<ref name=Goadsby /> [[Triptans]] are not helpful in tension-type headaches unless the person also has migraines.

He made a distinction between three different types of headache: i) cephalalgia, by which he indicates a shortlasting, mild headache; ii) cephalea, referring to a chronic type of headache; and iii) heterocrania, a paroxysmal headache on one side of the head.\nAnother classification system that resembles the modern ones was published by [[Thomas Willis]], in ''De Cephalalgia'' in 1672. In 1787 [[Christian Baur]] generally divided headaches into [[idiopathic]] (primary headaches) and [[symptomatic]] (secondary ones), and defined 84 categories.{{sfn|Levin et al.|2008|page=60}}\n\n== Children ==\nIn general, children suffer from the same types of headaches as adults do, but their symptoms may be slightly different.

Because these teratomas project from the fetal body into the surrounding [[Amniotic sac|amniotic fluid]], they can be seen during routine prenatal ultrasound exams.  Teratomas within the fetal body are less easily seen with ultrasound;  for these, MRI of the pregnant uterus is more informative.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Danzer E, Hubbard AM, Hedrick HL, etal |title=Diagnosis and characterization of fetal sacrococcygeal teratoma with prenatal MRI |journal=AJR Am J Roentgenol |volume=187 |issue=4 |pages=W350\u20136 |year=2006 |pmid=16985105 |doi=10.2214/AJR.05.0152 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kocaoglu M, Frush DP |title=Pediatric presacral masses |journal=Radiographics |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=833\u201357 |year=2006 |pmid=16702458 |doi=10.1148/rg.263055102 |url=}}</ref>\n\n"], "Q187255": ["Definition and symptoms -->\n'''Rheumatoid arthritis ''' ('''RA''') is a long-term [[autoimmune disorder]] that primarily affects [[synovial joint|joints]].<ref name=NIH2014/> It typically results in warm, swollen, and [[pain]]ful joints.<ref name=NIH2014/> Pain and stiffness often worsen following rest.<ref name=NIH2014/> Most commonly, the wrist and hands are involved, with the same joints typically involved on both sides of the body.<ref name=NIH2014/> The disease may also affect other parts of the body.<ref name=NIH2014/> This may result in a [[anemia|low red blood cell count]], [[pleurisy|inflammation around the lungs]], and [[pericarditis|inflammation around the heart]].<ref name=NIH2014/> Fever and low energy may also be present.<ref name=NIH2014>{{cite web|title=Handout on Health: Rheumatoid Arthritis|url=http://www.niams.nih.gov/health_info/Rheumatic_Disease/default.asp|website=National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases|accessdate=July 2, 2015|date=August 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630212818/http://niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Rheumatic_Disease/default.asp|archivedate=June 30, 2015|df=}}</ref> Often, symptoms come on gradually over weeks to months.<ref name=Majithia2007/>\n\n<!-- Cause and diganosis -->\nWhile the cause of rheumatoid arthritis is not clear, it is believed to involve a combination of [[genetics|genetic]] and environmental factors.<ref name=NIH2014/> The underlying mechanism involves the body's [[immune system]] attacking the joints.<ref name=NIH2014/> This results in inflammation and thickening of the [[synovium|joint capsule]].<ref name=NIH2014/> It also affects the underlying [[bone]] and [[cartilage]].<ref name=NIH2014/> The diagnosis is made mostly on the basis of a person's signs and symptoms.<ref name=Majithia2007/> [[medical imaging|X-rays]] and laboratory testing may support a diagnosis or exclude other diseases with similar symptoms.<ref name=NIH2014/> Other diseases that may present similarly include [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], [[psoriatic arthritis]], and [[fibromyalgia]] among others.<ref name=Majithia2007>{{cite journal |vauthors=Majithia V, Geraci SA | title = Rheumatoid arthritis: diagnosis and management | journal = Am.

As the appendix becomes more swollen and inflamed, it begins to irritate the adjoining abdominal wall. This leads to the localization of the pain to [[Right lower quadrant (abdomen)|the right lower quadrant]]. This classic migration of pain may not be seen in children under three years. This pain can be elicited through signs and can be severe. Signs include localized findings in the right [[iliac fossa]]. The abdominal wall becomes very sensitive to gentle pressure ([[palpation]]). There is severe pain on sudden release of deep pressure in the lower abdomen ([[rebound tenderness]]). If the appendix is retrocecal (localized behind the [[cecum]]), even deep pressure in the right lower quadrant may fail to elicit tenderness (silent appendix). This is because the [[cecum]], distended with gas, protects the inflamed appendix from pressure. Similarly, if the appendix lies entirely within the pelvis, there is usually complete absence of abdominal rigidity. In such cases, a digital [[rectal examination]] elicits tenderness in the rectovesical pouch. Coughing causes point tenderness in this area ([[McBurney's point]]), historically called [[Dunphy sign|Dunphy's sign]].\n\n"], "Q41112": ["Definition and symptoms -->\n'''Schizophrenia''' is a

When a nerve experiences [[synaptic fatigue]] it becomes unable to stimulate the muscle that it innervates. Most movements require a force far below what a muscle could potentially generate, and barring [[pathology]], neuromuscular fatigue is seldom an issue.\n\nFor extremely powerful contractions that are close to the upper limit of a muscle's ability to generate force, neuromuscular fatigue can become a limiting factor in untrained individuals. In novice [[strength training|strength trainers]], the muscle's ability to generate force is most strongly limited by nerve\u2019s ability to sustain a [[rate coding|high-frequency signal]]. After an extended period of maximum contraction, the nerve\u2019s signal reduces in frequency and the force generated by the contraction diminishes. There is no sensation of pain or discomfort, the muscle appears to simply \u2018stop listening\u2019 and gradually cease to move, often [[Muscle contraction#Eccentric contraction|lengthening]]. As there is insufficient stress on the muscles and tendons, there will often be no [[delayed onset muscle soreness]] following the workout.  Part of the process of strength training is increasing the nerve's ability to generate sustained, high frequency signals which allow a muscle to contract with their greatest force.  It is this \"neural training\" that causes several weeks worth of rapid gains in strength, which level off once the nerve is generating maximum contractions and the muscle reaches its physiological limit. Past this point, training effects increase muscular strength through myofibrillar or sarcoplasmic [[Muscle hypertrophy#Strength training|hypertrophy]] and metabolic fatigue becomes the factor limiting contractile force.\n\n====Peripheral muscle fatigue====\nPeripheral muscle fatigue during physical work is considered{{By whom|date=April 2012}} an inability for the body to supply sufficient energy or other metabolites to the contracting muscles to meet the increased energy demand. This is the most common case of physical fatigue\u2014affecting a national{{Where|date=April 2012}} average of 72% of adults in the work force in 2002. This causes contractile dysfunction that manifests in the eventual reduction or lack of ability of a single muscle or local group of muscles to do work. The insufficiency of energy, i.e. sub-optimal [[cellular respiration|aerobic metabolism]], generally results in the accumulation of [[lactic acid]] and other [[acid]]ic anaerobic metabolic by-products in the muscle, causing the stereotypical burning sensation of local muscle fatigue, though recent studies have indicated otherwise, actually finding that lactic acid is a source of energy.<ref name=robergs>{{cite journal |author1=R. Robergs |author2=F. Ghiasvand |author3=D.

Peripheral regulation  therefore depends on the localized metabolic chemical conditions of the local muscle affected, whereas the central model of muscle fatigue is an integrated mechanism that works to preserve the integrity of the system by initiating muscle fatigue through muscle derecruitment, based on collective feedback from the periphery, before cellular or organ failure occurs. Therefore, the feedback that is read by this central regulator could include chemical and mechanical as well as cognitive cues. The significance of each of these factors will depend on the nature of the fatigue-inducing work that is being performed.\n\nThough not universally used, \"metabolic fatigue\" is a common alternative term for peripheral muscle weakness, because of the reduction in contractile force due to the direct or indirect effects of the reduction of substrates or accumulation of metabolites within the [[muscle fiber|myocytes]]. This can occur through a simple lack of energy to fuel contraction, or through interference with the ability of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to stimulate [[actin]] and [[myosin]] to contract.\n\n====Lactic acid hypothesis====\nIt was once believed that [[lactic acid]] build-up was the cause of muscle fatigue.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sahlin K |title=Muscle fatigue and lactic acid accumulation |journal=Acta Physiol Scand Suppl |volume=556 |pages=83\u201391 |year=1986 |pmid=3471061 }}</ref>  The assumption was lactic acid had a \"pickling\" effect on muscles, inhibiting their ability to contract.  The impact of lactic acid on performance is now uncertain, it may assist or hinder muscle fatigue.\n\nProduced as a by-product of [[lactic acid fermentation|fermentation]], lactic acid can increase intracellular acidity of muscles.  This can lower the sensitivity of contractile apparatus to [[Calcium|calcium ions]] (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) but also has the effect of increasing [[cytoplasm]]ic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration through an inhibition of the [[sodium-calcium exchanger|chemical pump]] that [[Active transport|actively transports]] calcium out of the cell.  This counters inhibiting effects of [[Potassium|potassium ions]]  on muscular action potentials.  Lactic acid also has a negating effect on the chloride ions in the muscles, reducing their inhibition of contraction and leaving K<sup>+</sup> as the only restricting influence on muscle contractions, though the effects of potassium are much less than if there were no lactic acid to remove the chloride ions.  Ultimately, it is uncertain if lactic acid reduces fatigue through increased intracellular calcium or increases fatigue through reduced sensitivity of contractile proteins to Ca<sup>2+</sup>.\n==Management==\n{{Empty section|date=October 2017}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* [http://www.selmanholman.com/SHAweb_tools.htm Jun Mapili's Muscle Weakness Coding Checklist]\n* [http://health.allrefer.com/health/weakness-info.html AllRefer]\n* [http://www.mcardlesdisease.org Unexplained Muscle Weakness - Information About McArdle's Disease]\n\n{{Myopathy}}\n{{Common Cold}}\n\n[[Category:Symptoms and signs: Nervous system]]\n[[Category:Neurological disorders]]\n[[Category:Muscular disorders]]\n[[Category:Symptoms and signs: musculoskeletal system]]\n\n[[de:M\u00fcdigkeit]", " condition}}\n\n:''\"Asthenia\" redirects here.

There are several circuits within the hypothalamus that contribute to its role in integrating appetite, the [[melanocortin]] pathway being the most well understood.<ref name=\"flier\"/> The circuit begins with an area of the hypothalamus, the [[arcuate nucleus]], that has outputs to the [[lateral hypothalamus]] (LH) and [[ventromedial hypothalamus]] (VMH), the brain's feeding and satiety centers, respectively.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Boulpaep, Emile L. |author2=Boron, Walter F. |title=Medical physiology: A cellular and molecular approach |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2003 |page=1227 |isbn=0-7216-3256-4}}</ref>\n\nThe arcuate nucleus contains two distinct groups of [[neuron]]s.<ref name=\"flier\"/> The first group coexpresses [[neuropeptide Y]] (NPY) and [[agouti-related peptide]] (AgRP) and has stimulatory inputs to the LH and inhibitory inputs to the VMH.

Consequently, NPY/AgRP neurons stimulate feeding and inhibit satiety, while POMC/CART neurons stimulate satiety and inhibit feeding. Both groups of arcuate nucleus neurons are regulated in part by leptin. Leptin inhibits the NPY/AgRP group while stimulating the POMC/CART group.

In case of duodenal ulcers the pain appears about three hours after taking a meal;\n*[[bloating]] and abdominal fullness;\n*[[Hypersalivation|waterbrash]] (rush of saliva after an episode of regurgitation to dilute the acid in esophagus - although this is more associated with [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]]);\n*nausea and copious vomiting;\n*[[Anorexia (symptom)|loss of appetite]] and weight loss;\n*[[hematemesis]] (vomiting of blood); this can occur due to bleeding directly from a gastric ulcer, or from damage to the esophagus from severe/continuing vomiting.\n*[[melena]] (tarry, foul-smelling feces due to presence of [[oxidation|oxidized]] iron from [[hemoglobin]]);\n*rarely, an ulcer can lead to a gastric or [[Gastrointestinal perforation|duodenal perforation]], which leads to [[acute peritonitis]], extreme, stabbing pain,<ref>Bhat, Sriram (2013).

Medicines associated with peptic ulcer include [[NSAID]]s (non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs) that inhibit [[cyclooxygenase]], and most [[glucocorticoid]]s (e.g. [[dexamethasone]] and [[prednisolone]]).\n\nIn people over the age of 45 with more than two weeks of the above symptoms, the odds for peptic ulceration are high enough to warrant rapid investigation by [[esophagogastroduodenoscopy]].\n\nThe timing of the symptoms in relation to the meal may differentiate between gastric and duodenal ulcers: A gastric ulcer would give [[epigastrium|epigastric]] pain during the meal, associated with nausea and vomitng, as [[gastric acid]] production is increased as food enters the stomach. Pain in duodenal ulcers would be aggravated by hunger, relieved by a meal, and is associated with night pain.<ref name=\"Angel 2017\"/>\n\nAlso, the symptoms of peptic ulcers may vary with the location of the ulcer and the person's age.

The pain caused by peptic ulcers can be felt anywhere from the navel up to the [[Human sternum|sternum]], it may last from few minutes to several hours and it may be worse when the stomach is empty.

Causes of atrophy include [[mutation]]s (which can destroy the gene to build up the organ), poor nourishment, poor [[circulatory system|circulation]], loss of [[hormone|hormonal]] support, loss of [[nerve]] supply to the target [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]], excessive amount of [[apoptosis]] of cells, and disuse or lack of [[exercise]] or disease intrinsic to the tissue itself. In medical practice, hormonal and nerve inputs that maintain an organ or body part are said to have ''trophic'' effects. A diminished muscular trophic condition is designated as ''atrophy''. Atrophy is reduction in size of cell, organ or tissue, after attaining its normal mature growth. In contrast, hypoplasia is the reduction in size of a cell, organ, or tissue that has not attained normal maturity.\n\nAtrophy is the general [[physiological]] process of reabsorption and breakdown of [[biological tissue|tissues]], involving apoptosis. When it occurs as a result of disease or loss of trophic support due to other disease, it is termed ''pathological atrophy'', although it can be a part of normal body development and [[homeostasis]] as well.\n{{-plasia}}\n"], "Q560337": ["", "hs disease]] {{R from other capitalisation}"], "Q188297": ["", "=\nSymptoms vary from person to person, and may come and go.

About 15% of all cases of [[Sudden cardiac death|sudden death]] are attributable to PE.<ref name=Goldhaber/>\n\nOn physical examination, the lungs are usually normal. Occasionally, a [[pleural friction rub]] may be audible over the affected area of the lung (mostly in PE with [[Infarction|infarct]]). A [[pleural effusion]] is sometimes present that is exudative, detectable by decreased percussion note, audible breath sounds, and vocal resonance.

Larger PEs, which tend to lodge centrally, typically cause dyspnea, hypoxia, [[hypotension|low blood pressure]], [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]] and [[syncope (medicine)|fainting]], but are often painless because there is no lung infarction due to collateral circulation. The classic presentation for PE with pleuritic pain, dyspnea and tachycardia is likely caused by a large fragmented embolism causing both large and small PEs. Thus, small PEs are often missed because they cause pleuritic pain alone without any other findings and large PEs often missed because they are painless and mimic other conditions often causing ECG changes and small rises in troponin and BNP levels.<ref>Pregerson DB, Quick Essentials: Emergency Medicine, 4th edition.

The duration of the disease can vary from a few weeks to many months or even years.\n\nIn the first stage of the disease, [[bacteremia]] occurs and leads to the classic triad of undulant fevers, sweating (often with characteristic foul moldy smell sometimes likened to wet hay), and migratory [[arthralgia]] and [[myalgia]] (joint and muscle pain). Blood tests characteristically reveal a [[leukopenia|low number of white blood cells]] and [[anemia|red blood cells]], show some elevation of liver enzymes such as [[aspartate aminotransferase]] (AST) and [[alanine aminotransferase]] (ALT), and demonstrate positive Bengal Rose and Huddleston reactions.

People with circadian rhythm sleep disorders are unable to go to sleep and awaken at the times commonly required for work and school as well as social needs. They are generally able to get enough sleep if allowed to sleep and wake at the times dictated by their \"body clocks\". The quality of their sleep is usually normal unless they also have another sleep disorder.\n\nHumans, like most living organisms, have various biological rhythms. [[Circadian rhythms]], often referred to as the body clock or the [[Circadian rhythm#Biological clock in mammals|biological clock]], control processes that re-occur daily, e.g. [[body temperature]], [[alertness]], and [[hormone]] secretion as well as sleep timing. Due to the circadian clock, sleepiness does not continuously increase throughout the day; a person's desire and ability to fall asleep is influenced both by the length of time since the person woke from an adequate sleep and by internal circadian rhythms. Thus, a person's body is ready for sleep and for wakefulness at relatively specific times of the day.\n\nSleep researcher Yaron Dagan states that \"[t]hese disorders can lead to harmful psychological and functional difficulties and are often misdiagnosed and incorrectly treated {{not a typo|due to the fact that}} doctors are unaware of their existence\".<ref>\n{{Cite journal \n| last = Dagan | first = Yaron |date=February 2002 \n| title = Circadian rhythm sleep disorders (CRSD) \n| journal = Sleep Medicine Reviews | volume = 6 | issue = 1 \n| pages = 45\u201354 | publisher = Elsevier \n| issn = | pmid = 12531141| doi = 10.1053/smrv.2001.0190 \n| url = http://www.smrv-journal.com/article/S1087-0792(01)90190-X/abstract \n| format = Abstract \n| accessdate = 2010-10-13 | quote =  \n}}\n</ref>\n\n"], "Q580285": ["", "=\n\nThe following signs are associated with the disease\n\n*Abnormal heart development\n*Abnormal skeletal development\n*Hypermobile joints\n*Large fingers\n*[[Genu valgum|Knock-knees]]\n*[[Human tooth#Developmental|Widely spaced teeth]]\n*Bell-shaped chest (flared ribs)\n*Compression of [[spinal cord]]\n*[[Enlarged heart]]\n*[[Dwarfism]]\n*[[Heart murmur]]\n* below average height for certain age\n\nPatients with Morquio syndrome appear healthy at birth.<ref name=\"MPSSoc IV\" /> They often present with spinal deformity, and there is growth retardation and possibly [[genu valgum]] in the second or third year of life.

Other symptoms include low grade fever, swollen glands (sub-occipital and posterior cervical [[lymphadenopathy]]), [[arthralgia|joint pains]], [[headache]], and [[conjunctivitis]].<ref name=\"pmid16022642\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Edlich RF, Winters KL, Long WB, Gubler KD |title=Rubella and congenital rubella (German measles)|journal=J Long Term Eff Med Implants|volume=15|issue=3|pages=319\u201328|year=2005|pmid=16022642|doi= 10.1615/JLongTermEffMedImplants.v15.i3.80}}</ref>\n\nThe swollen [[gland]]s or [[lymph nodes]] can persist for up to a week and the [[fever]] rarely rises above 38&nbsp;\u00b0C (100.4&nbsp;\u00b0F). The rash of German measles is typically pink or light red. The rash causes itching and often lasts for about three days. The rash disappears after a few days with no staining or peeling of the skin. When the rash clears up, the skin might shed in very small flakes where the rash covered it.

A patient with a constant eye turn of significant magnitude is very easy to notice. However, a small magnitude or intermittent strabismus can easily be missed upon casual observation. In any case, an [[eye care professional]] can conduct various tests, such as cover testing, to determine the full extent of the strabismus.\n\nSymptoms of strabismus include [[diplopia|double vision]] and/or [[asthenopia|eye strain]]. To avoid double vision, the brain may adapt by [[Suppression (eye)|ignoring one eye]]. In this case, often no noticeable symptoms are seen other than a minor loss of depth perception. This deficit may not be noticeable in someone who has had strabismus since birth or early childhood, as they have likely learned to judge depth and distances using [[Monocular depth cues|monocular cues]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}. However, a constant unilateral strabismus causing constant suppression is a risk for [[amblyopia]] in children. Small-angle and intermittent strabismus are more likely to cause disruptive visual symptoms. In addition to headaches and eye strain, symptoms may include an inability to read comfortably, fatigue when reading, and unstable or \"jittery\" vision.\n\n"], "Q327281": ["", "is D]] {{R from other capitalisation}"], "Q208726": ["", ""], "Q12204": ["Definition and symptoms -->\n'''Tuberculosis''' ('''TB''') is an [[infectious disease]] usually caused by the bacterium ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' (MTB).<ref name=WHO2015Fact/> Tuberculosis generally affects the [[lung]]s, but can also affect other parts of the body.<ref name=WHO2015Fact/> Most infections do not have symptoms, in which case it is known as [[latent tuberculosis]].<ref name=WHO2015Fact/> About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those infected.<ref name=WHO2015Fact/> The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic [[cough]] with [[hemoptysis|blood-containing]] [[sputum]], [[fever]], [[night sweats]], and [[weight loss]].<ref name=WHO2015Fact/> The historical term \"'''consumption'''\" came about due to the weight loss.<ref name=Cha1998>{{cite book|title=The Chambers Dictionary.|year=1998|publisher=Allied Chambers India Ltd.|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-86062-25-8|pages=352|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pz2ORay2HWoC&pg=RA1-PA352|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906201311/https://books.google.com/books?id=pz2ORay2HWoC&pg=RA1-PA352|archive-date=6 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Infection]] of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms.<ref name=ID10>{{cite book|last=Dolin|first=[edited by] Gerald L.

Therefore, data estimating the prevalence of infertility cited by various sources differs significantly.<ref name=\"Doihumupddmr\" /> A couple that tries unsuccessfully to have a child after a certain period of time (often a short period, but definitions vary) is sometimes said to be '''subfertile''', meaning less fertile than a typical couple. Both infertility and subfertility are defined as the inability to conceive after a certain period of time (the length of which vary), so often the two terms overlap.\n\n===World Health Organization===\nThe [[World Health Organization]] defines infertility as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/infertility/definitions/en/ |title=WHO &#124; Infertility |publisher=Who.int |date=2013-03-19 |accessdate=2013-06-17}}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|Infertility is \u201ca disease of the reproductive system defined by the failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected [[sexual intercourse]] (and there is no other reason, such as breastfeeding or postpartum [[amenorrhoea]]). Primary infertility is infertility in a couple who have never had a child. Secondary infertility is failure to conceive following a previous pregnancy. Infertility may be caused by infection in the man or woman, but often there is no obvious underlying cause.}}\n\n===United States===\nOne definition of infertility that is frequently used in the United States by [[reproductive endocrinologist]]s, doctors who specialize in infertility, to consider a couple eligible for treatment is:\n* a woman under 35 has not conceived after 12 months of contraceptive-free intercourse. Twelve months is the lower [[reference limit]] for ''Time to Pregnancy'' (TTP) by the World Health Organization.<ref name=who2010>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cooper TG, Noonan E, von Eckardstein S, Auger J, Baker HW, Behre HM, Haugen TB, Kruger T, Wang C, Mbizvo MT, Vogelsong KM | title = World Health Organization reference values for human semen characteristics | journal = Hum.

The idea is that for women beyond age 35, every month counts and if made to wait another 6 months to prove the necessity of medical intervention, the problem could become worse. The corollary to this is that, by definition, failure to conceive in women under 35 isn't regarded with the same urgency as it is in those over 35.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nIn the UK, previous [[NICE guideline]]s defined infertility as failure to conceive after regular unprotected sexual intercourse for 2 years in the absence of known reproductive pathology.<ref name=nice>{{cite book |title=Fertility: Assessment and Treatment for People with Fertility Problems |publisher=RCOG Press |location=London |year=2004 |isbn=1-900364-97-2 |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG011publicinfoenglish.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rhjtxNOs?url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG011publicinfoenglish.pdf |archivedate=3 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Updated NICE guidelines do not include a specific definition, but recommend that \"A woman of reproductive age who has not conceived after 1 year of unprotected vaginal sexual intercourse, in the absence of any known cause of infertility, should be offered further clinical assessment and investigation along with her partner, with earlier referral to a specialist if the woman is over 36 years of age.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG156|title=Fertility: assessment and treatment for people with fertility problems, section: Defining infertility|work= [[NICE Clinical guidelines]], CG156  |date= February 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Other definitions===\nResearchers commonly base demographic studies on infertility prevalence on a five-year period.<ref>http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/infertility/DHS-CR9.pdf</ref> Practical measurement problems, however, exist for any definition, because it is difficult to measure continuous exposure to the risk of pregnancy over a period of years.\n\n===Primary vs. secondary infertility===\nPrimary infertility is defined as the absence of a live birth for women who desire a child and have been in a union for at least 12 months, during which they have not used any contraceptives.<ref>[http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/infertility/definitions/en/]</ref> The World Health Organisation also adds that 'women whose pregnancy spontaneously miscarries, or whose pregnancy results in a still born child, without ever having had a live birth would present with primarily infertility'.<ref name=\"who.int\">http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/infertility/definitions/en/</ref>\n\nSecondary infertility is defined as the absence of a live birth for women who desire a child and have been in a union for at least 12 months since their last live birth, during which they did not use any contraceptives.<ref name=\"who.int\"/>\n\nThus the distinguishing feature is whether or not the couple have ever had a pregnancy which led to a live birth.\n\n==Effects==\n\n===Psychological ===\nThe consequences of infertility are manifold and can include societal repercussions and personal suffering. Advances in assisted reproductive technologies, such as IVF, can offer hope to many couples where treatment is available, although barriers exist in terms of medical coverage and affordability.

Infertility may be caused by blockage of the Fallopian tube due to malformations, infections such as [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] and/or scar tissue. For example, [[endometriosis]] can cause infertility with the growth of endometrial tissue in the Fallopian tubes and/or around the ovaries. Endometriosis is usually more common in women in their mid-twenties and older, especially when postponed childbirth has taken place.<ref name=\"Lessey\">Lessy, B.A. (2000) ''Medical management of endometriosis and infertility: 1089-1096.''</ref>\n\nAnother major cause of infertility in women may be the inability to [[ovulate]]. Malformation of the eggs themselves may complicate conception.  For example, [[polycystic ovarian syndrome]] is when the eggs only partially developed within the ovary and there is an excess of male hormones. Some women are infertile because their ovaries do not mature and release eggs. In this case synthetic FSH by injection or Clomid (Clomiphene citrate) via a pill can be given to stimulate follicles to mature in the ovaries.\n\nOther factors that can affect a woman's chances of conceiving include being overweight or underweight,<ref>{{cite web|title=Are You At Your Optimal Weight?|url=https://www.chelseafertilitynyc.com/resources/optimal-weight-exercise/|website=Chelsea Fertility NYC|accessdate=6 March 2015}}</ref> or her age as female fertility declines after the age of 30.<ref>{{cite web|title=Should I Freeze My Eggs|url=https://www.pacificfertilitycenter.com/fertility-preservation/my-eggs#assessment|website=Information on Egg Freezing|accessdate=6 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nSometimes it can be a combination of factors, and sometimes a clear cause is never established.\n\nCommon causes of infertility of females include:\n* ovulation problems (e.g. [[polycystic ovarian syndrome]], PCOS, the leading reason why women present to fertility clinics due to anovulatory infertility.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Balen AH, Dresner M, Scott EM, Drife JO | title = Should obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome receive treatment for infertility? | journal = BMJ | volume = 332 | issue = 7539 | pages = 434\u20135 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16497735 | pmc = 1382524 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.332.7539.434 }}</ref>)\n* tubal blockage\n* [[pelvic inflammatory disease]] caused by infections like [[tuberculosis]]\n* age-related factors\n* uterine problems\n* previous [[tubal ligation]]\n* [[endometriosis]]\n* [[advanced maternal age]]\n* immune infertility\n\n===Males===\n{{Further information|Male infertility}}\nThe main cause of male infertility is low [[semen quality]]. In men who have the necessary reproductive organs to procreate, infertility can be caused by low sperm count due to endocrine problems, drugs, radiation, or infection.  There may be testicular malformations, hormone imbalance, or blockage of the man's duct system. Although many of these can be treated through surgery or hormonal substitutions, some may be indefinite.<ref name=\"Mishail\">Mishail, A., et al.

In other cases, the cause is suspected to be immunological or genetic; it may be that each partner is independently fertile but the couple cannot conceive together without assistance.\n\n===Unexplained infertility===\n{{Main article|Unexplained infertility}}\nIn the US, up to 20% of infertile couples have unexplained infertility.<ref>[http://www.advancedfertility.com/unexplai.htm Unexplained Infertility Background, Tests and Treatment Options] Advanced Fertility Center of Chicago</ref> In these cases abnormalities are likely to be present but not detected by current methods. Possible problems could be that the egg is not released at the optimum time for fertilization, that it may not enter the fallopian tube, sperm may not be able to reach the egg, fertilization may fail to occur, transport of the zygote may be disturbed, or implantation fails. It is increasingly recognized that egg quality is of critical importance and women of advanced maternal age have eggs of reduced capacity for normal and successful fertilization.  Also, [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]] in [[folate pathway]] genes could be one reason for fertility complications in some women with unexplained infertility.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Altm\u00e4e S, Stavreus-Evers A, Ruiz JR, Laanpere M, Syv\u00e4nen T, Yngve A, Salumets A, Nilsson TK | title = Variations in folate pathway genes are associated with unexplained female infertility | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 94 | issue = 1 | pages = 130\u2013137 | year = 2010 | pmid = 19324355 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.02.025 }}</ref> However, a growing body of evidence suggests that epigenetic modifications in sperm may be partially responsible.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Kenneth I.

The doctor or WHNP may also be able to suggest lifestyle changes to increase the chances of conceiving.<ref>[http://www.hfea.gov.uk/en/804.html Infertility Help: When & where to get help for fertility treatment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225235604/http://www.hfea.gov.uk/en/804.html |date=25 December 2008 }}</ref>\n\nWomen over the age of 35 should see their physician or WHNP after six months as fertility tests can take some time to complete, and age may affect the treatment options that are open in that case.\n\nA doctor or WHNP takes a medical history and gives a physical examination. They can also carry out some basic tests on both partners to see if there is an identifiable reason for not having achieved a pregnancy. If necessary, they refer patients to a fertility clinic or local hospital for more specialized tests. The results of these tests help determine the best fertility treatment.\n\n==Treatment==<!-- This section is linked from [[Pro-choice]] -->\n{{See also|Male infertility#Hormonal therapy}}\nTreatment depends on the cause of infertility, but may include counselling, fertility treatments, which include in vitro fertilization. According to [[ESHRE]] recommendations, couples with an estimated [[live birth rate]] of 40% or higher per year are encouraged to continue aiming for a spontaneous pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Failures (with some successes) of assisted reproduction and gamete donation programs | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 354\u2013365 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23459992 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmt007 }}</ref> Treatment methods for infertility may be grouped as medical or complementary and alternative treatments.

If the sperm are of good quality and the mechanics of the woman's reproductive structures are good (patent fallopian tubes, no adhesions or scarring), a course of ovarian stimulating medication maybe used. The physician or WHNP may also suggest using a conception cap [[cervical cap]], which the patient uses at home by placing the sperm inside the cap and putting the [[conception device]] on the cervix, or intrauterine insemination (IUI), in which the doctor or WHNP introduces sperm into the uterus during ovulation, via a catheter. In these methods, [[fertilization]] occurs inside the body.\n\nIf conservative medical treatments fail to achieve a full term pregnancy, the physician or WHNP may suggest the patient undergo [[in vitro fertilization]] (IVF). IVF and related techniques ([[Intracytoplasmic sperm injection|ICSI]], [[ZIFT]], [[Gamete intrafallopian transfer|GIFT]]) are called [[assisted reproductive technology]] (ART) techniques.\n\nART techniques generally start with stimulating the ovaries to increase egg production. After stimulation, the physician surgically extracts one or more eggs from the ovary, and unites them with sperm in a laboratory setting, with the intent of producing one or more embryos. Fertilization takes place outside the body, and the fertilized egg is reinserted into the woman's reproductive tract, in a procedure called [[embryo transfer]].\n\nOther medical techniques are e.g. [[tuboplasty]], assisted hatching, and [[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis]].\n\n\n====In vitro fertilization====\n\nIVF is the most commonly used ART. It has been proven useful in overcoming infertility conditions, such as blocked or damaged tubes, endometriosis, repeated IUI failure, unexplained infertility, poor ovarian reserve, poor or even nil sperm count.\n\n====Intracytoplasmic sperm injection ====\n\nICSI technique is used in case of poor semen quality, low sperm count or failed fertilization attempts during prior IVF cycles. This technique involves an injection of a single healthy sperm directly injected into mature egg. The fertilized embryo is then transferred to womb.\n\n===Tourism===\n{{Main article|Fertility tourism}}\n''Fertility tourism'' is the practice of traveling to another country for fertility treatments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/fertilitytourism.asp|title=fertility tourism - Word Spy|author=Paul McFedries|work=wordspy.com}}</ref> It may be regarded as a form of [[medical tourism]]. The main reasons for fertility tourism are legal regulation of the sought procedure in the home country, or lower price. [[In-vitro fertilization]] and [[donor insemination]] are major procedures involved.\n\n==Epidemiology==\nPrevalence of infertility varies depending on the definition, i.e. on the time span involved in the failure to conceive.\n\n*Infertility rates have increased by 4% since the 1980s, mostly from problems with [[fecundity]] due to an increase in age.<ref>{{cite book|last=Maheshwari|first=A.|title=Human Reproduction|year=2008|pages=538\u2013542}}</ref>\n*Fertility problems affect one in seven couples in the UK. Most couples (about 84%) who have regular [[sexual intercourse]] (that is, every two to three days) and who do not use contraception get pregnant within a year. About 92 out of 100 couples who are trying to get pregnant do so within two years.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/index.jsp?action=download&o=29271|title=An error has occurred - NICE|work=nice.org.uk}}</ref>\n* Women become less fertile as they get older. For women aged 35, about 94% who have regular unprotected sexual intercourse get pregnant after three years of trying. For women aged 38, however, only about 77%. The effect of age upon men's fertility is less clear.<ref name=autogenerated1/>\n* In people going forward for IVF in the UK, roughly half of fertility problems with a diagnosed cause are due to problems with the man, and about half due to problems with the woman. However, about one in five cases of infertility has no clear diagnosed cause.<ref>[http://www.hfea.gov.uk/en/1215.html#Reasons_for_infertility HFEA Chart on reasons for infertility]</ref>\n*In Britain, male factor infertility accounts for 25% of infertile couples, while 25% remain unexplained. 50% are female causes with 25% being due to [[anovulation]] and 25% tubal problems/other.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Khan, Khalid |author2=Janesh K.

If [[natural selection]] is the primary error correction mechanism that prevents random mutations on the Y chromosome, then fertility treatments for men with abnormal sperm (in particular [[Intracytoplasmic sperm injection|ICSI]]) only defer the underlying problem to the next male generation.\n\nMany countries have special frameworks for dealing with the ethical and social issues around fertility treatment.\n\n* One of the best known is the [[HFEA]] \u2013 The UK's regulator for fertility treatment and embryo research.

An important factor, argues Inhorn,<ref name=\"2003 p.1839\"/> is the positioning of men within the paradigm of reproductive health, whereby because rates of general infertility mask differences between male and female infertility, men remain a largely invisible facet within the theorisation and discourse surrounding infertility, as well as the related treatments and biotechnologies. This is particularly significant given that male infertility accounts for more than half of all cases of infertility <ref>(Inhorn 2003 p.1831)</ref> and moreover, it is evident that the attitudes and behaviours of men have profound implications for the reproductive health of both individuals and couples.<ref>(Inhorn 2003 p.1842-3)</ref> For example, Inhorn <ref name=\"Inhorn 2003 p.1842\"/> notes that when couples in Egypt are faced with seemingly intractable infertility problems - due to a range of family and societal pressures that centre around the place of children in constituting the gender identity of men and women - it is often the women who is forced to seek continued treatment; this continues to occur, even in known instances of male infertility and that the constant seeking of treatment frequently becomes iatrogenic for the women. Inhorn states that infertility often leads to \u201cmarital demise, physical violence, emotional abuse, social exclusion, community exile, ineffective and iatrogenic therapies, poverty, old age insecurity, increased risk of HIV/AIDS, and death\u201d<ref name=\"Gerrits and Shaw 2010\"/>  Significantly, Inhorn demonstrates that this phenomenon can not simply be explained by a lack of knowledge, rather it occurs in a complex interaction between the centrality of children in the male gender identity as a symbol of maturity and the relative lack of power of women in Egyptian society, whereby they effectively become scapegoats for a culturally accepted narrative as a site of blame for the lack of childlessness. It should be emphasised that this is not simply an issue of \u201cwomen oppressed by men\u201d but rather, that men and women both share the burden of this narrative, but in different, unequal and highly complex ways.   Therefore, while the notion that reproductive health is a \u2018women\u2019s issue\u2019, may have powerful social currency, especially within popular discourse and indigenous systems of meaning, the reality of infertility suggests that medical and health paradigms have a significant part to play in challenging the validity of this entrenched belief . Moreover, the effectiveness of any therapeutic intervention, medical or otherwise will be contingent on such outcomes and has an important part to play in the alleviation of gendered suffering, especially the burden imposed on women, who continue to suffer disproportionately from the effects of infertility.\n\nHigh costs may also be a factor and research by the Genk Institute for Fertility Technology, in Belgium, claimed a much lower cost methodology (about 90% reduction) with similar efficacy, which may be suitable for some fertility treatment.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-23223752 | work=BBC News | title=IVF as cheap as \u00a3170, doctors claim | date=8 July 2013}}</ref> At the 1994 United Nations International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo, the prevention and treatment of infertility was accepted into the program of action for reproductive healthcare. Infertility has shown to have a greater effect on developing nations than on birth rates or population control, but also on a social level as well. Reproduction is a large aspect of life for many cultures within developing nations, and infertility can lead to social and familial problems such as rejection or abandonment as well as personal psychological issues. Currently, fertility treatment options and programs are only available through private health sectors in developing nations and little-to-no treatment is available through public health sectors. The fertility treatment options offered through the private sectors are often costly or not easily accessible. Additionally, counseling is considered an essential aspect of fertility treatment, and due to lack of education and resources such forms of therapy remain scarce as well. While quality fertility care is not readily available in developing nations (such as sub-Saharan African countries), a standard procedure of care could be easily implemented for a low cost as a basic intervention. The lack of fertility treatment is problematic, and high birth and population rates are every reason to implement treatment options rather than reject them.<ref name=\"Gerrits and Shaw 2010\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Advanced maternal age]]\n*[[Childlessness]]\n*[[Conception device]]\n*[[Inherited sterility in insects]]\n*[[Medical ethics]]\n*[[Oncofertility]], fertility in cancer patients\n*[[Sterility (physiology)|Sterility]]\n*[[Surrogate marriage]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n* {{cite journal | author = Inhorn MC | year = 2003 | title = Global infertility and the globalization of new reproductive technologies: illustrations from Egypt | url = | journal = Social Science & Medicine | volume = 56 | issue = 9| pages = 1837\u20131851 | doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(02)00208-3}}\n* Lock, Margaret and Vinh-Kim Nguyen. 2011.

The first division is between its ''[[Acute (medical)|acute]]'' and ''[[chronic (medicine)|chronic]]'' forms:\n\n* [[Acute leukemia]] is characterized by a rapid increase in the number of immature blood cells. The crowding that results from such cells makes the bone marrow unable to produce healthy blood cells. Immediate treatment is required in acute leukemia because of the rapid progression and accumulation of the [[malignant cells]], which then spill over into the bloodstream and spread to other organs of the body. Acute forms of leukemia are the most common forms of [[childhood leukemia|leukemia in children]].\n* [[Chronic leukemia]] is characterized by the excessive buildup of relatively mature, but still abnormal, white blood cells. Typically taking months or years to progress, the cells are produced at a much higher rate than normal, resulting in many abnormal white blood cells. Whereas acute leukemia must be treated immediately, chronic forms are sometimes monitored for some time before treatment to ensure maximum effectiveness of therapy. Chronic leukemia mostly occurs in older people, but can occur in any age group.\n\nAdditionally, the diseases are subdivided according to which kind of blood cell is affected. This divides leukemias into lymphoblastic or ''[[lymphocytic leukemia]]s'' and myeloid or ''[[myelogenous leukemia]]s'':\n\n* In lymphoblastic or [[lymphocytic leukemia]]s, the cancerous change takes place in a type of marrow cell that normally goes on to form [[lymphocyte]]s, which are infection-fighting immune system cells. Most lymphocytic leukemias involve a specific subtype of lymphocyte, the [[B&nbsp;cell]].\n* In myeloid or [[myelogenous leukemia]]s, the cancerous change takes place in a [[myeloid cells|type of marrow cell]] that normally goes on to form [[red blood cell]]s, some other types of white cells, and [[platelet]]s.\n\nCombining these two classifications provides a total of four main categories. Within each of these main categories, there are typically several subcategories. Finally, some rarer types are usually considered to be outside of this classification scheme.\n\n===Specific types===\n* [[Acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] (ALL) is the most common type of leukemia in young children. It also affects adults, especially those 65 and older. Standard treatments involve [[chemotherapy]] and [[radiotherapy]]. The survival rates vary by age: 85% in children and 50% in adults.<ref name=\"isbn0-07-140235-7\">{{cite book|author=Jameson, J. N. St C.; Dennis L.

This means people with leukemia may easily become [[purpura|bruised]], [[hemorrhage|bleed]] excessively, or develop pinprick bleeds ([[petechia]]e).\n\n[[White blood cell]]s, which are involved in fighting [[pathogen]]s, may be suppressed or dysfunctional. This could cause the patient's immune system to be unable to fight off a simple infection or to start attacking other body cells. Because leukemia prevents the immune system from working normally, some patients experience frequent [[infection]], ranging from infected [[tonsil]]s, [[oral ulcer|sores in the mouth]], or [[diarrhea]] to life-threatening [[pneumonia]] or [[opportunistic infection]]s.\n\nFinally, the red blood cell deficiency leads to [[anemia]], which may  cause [[dyspnea]] and [[wikt:pallor|pallor]].\n\nSome patients experience other symptoms, such as [[malaise|feeling sick]], having fevers, chills, night sweats, feeling [[fatigue (medical)|fatigued]] and other [[flu-like symptoms]]. Some patients experience nausea or a feeling of fullness due to an enlarged [[liver]] and [[spleen]]; this can result in unintentional [[Weight loss#Intentional weight loss|weight loss]].

Uncommon neurological symptoms like [[migraines]], [[seizures]], or [[coma]] can occur as a result of brain stem pressure. All symptoms associated with leukemia can be attributed to other diseases. Consequently, leukemia is always diagnosed through [[medical test]]s.\n\nThe word ''leukemia'', which means 'white blood', is derived from the characteristic high white blood cell count that presents in most afflicted patients before treatment. The high number of white blood cells are apparent when a blood sample is [[Blood film|viewed under a microscope]], with the extra white blood cells frequently being immature or dysfunctional. The excessive number of cells can also interfere with the level of other cells, causing further harmful imbalance in the blood count.\n\nSome leukemia patients do not have high white blood cell counts visible during a regular blood count. This less-common condition is called ''aleukemia''. The bone marrow still contains cancerous white blood cells which disrupt the normal production of blood cells, but they remain in the marrow instead of entering the bloodstream, where they would be visible in a blood test. For an aleukemic patient, the white blood cell counts in the bloodstream can be normal or low. Aleukemia can occur in any of the four major types of leukemia, and is particularly common in [[hairy cell leukemia]].<ref name=ACS1/>\n\n"], "Q467635": ["Definition and symptoms -->\n'''Multiple

This is known as the [[catarrhal]] stage. After one to two weeks, the coughing classically develops into uncontrollable fits, each with five to ten forceful coughs, followed by a high-pitched \"whoop\" sound in younger children, or a gasping sound in older children, as the person tries to inhale ([[Paroxysmal attack|paroxysmal]] stage).\n\nCoughing fits can occur on their own or can be triggered by yawning, stretching, laughing, eating, or yelling; they usually occur in groups, with multiple episodes on an hourly basis throughout the day. This stage usually lasts two to eight weeks, or sometimes longer. A gradual transition then occurs to the convalescent stage, which usually lasts one to four weeks. This stage is marked by a decrease in paroxysms of coughing, both in frequency and severity, and a cessation of vomiting. A tendency to produce the \"whooping\" sound after coughing may remain for a considerable period after the disease itself has cleared up.\n\n"], "Q495146": ["Definitions and symptoms -->\n'''Trichinosis''' is a [[parasitic disease]] caused by [[nematodes|roundworms]] of the ''[[Trichinella]]'' type.<ref name=CDC2013DP/> During the initial infection, invasion of the [[intestines]] can result in [[diarrhea]], [[abdominal pain]], and [[vomiting]].<ref name=CDC2013DP/> Migration of [[larvae]] to muscle, which occurs about a week after being infected, can cause [[edema|swelling]] of the face, [[conjunctivitis|inflammation of the whites of the eyes]], [[fever]], [[myalgia|muscle pains]], and a [[rash]].<ref name=CDC2013DP/> Minor infection may be [[asymptomatic|without symptoms]].<ref name=CDC2013DP/> Complications may include [[myocarditis|inflammation of heart muscle]], [[central nervous system]] involvement, and [[pneumonitis|inflammation of the lungs]].<ref name=CDC2013DP>{{Cite web|title = CDC -

When sciatica is caused by compression of a [[dorsal root|dorsal nerve root]] ([[Radix (disambiguation)|radix]]), it is considered a lumbar [[radiculopathy]] (or radiculitis when accompanied with an inflammatory response). This can occur as a result of a spinal disk bulge or [[spinal disc herniation]] (a herniated [[intervertebral disc]]), or from roughening, enlarging, or misalignment (''[[spondylolisthesis]]'') of the [[vertebra]]e, or as a result of [[degenerative disc disease|degenerated discs]] that can reduce the diameter of the lateral foramen (natural hole) through which nerve roots exit the spine. The intervertebral discs consist of an anulus fibrosus, which forms a ring surrounding the inner nucleus pulposus. When there is a tear in the [[Anulus fibrosus disci intervertebralis|anulus fibrosus]], the nucleus pulposus (pulp) may extrude through the tear and press against spinal nerves within the spinal cord, [[cauda equina]], or exiting nerve roots, causing inflammation, numbness, or excruciating pain. Inflammation of the spinal canal can also spread to adjacent [[Zygapophysial joint|facet joints]] and cause lower back pain and/or [[referred pain]] in the posterior thigh(s). Pseudosciatic pain can also be caused by compression of peripheral sections of the nerve, usually from soft tissue tension in the [[piriformis]] or related [[muscle]]s.\n\nThe spinal discs are composed of a tough spongiform ring of cartilage (\"[[Anulus fibrosus disci intervertebralis|anulus fibrosus]]\") with a more malleable center (\"[[nucleus pulposus]]\"). The discs separate the vertebrae, thereby allowing room for the nerve roots to properly exit through the spaces between the vertebrae. The discs cushion the spine from compressive forces, but are weak to pressure applied during rotational movements. That is why a person who bends to one side, at a bad angle to pick something up, may more likely herniate a spinal disc than a person jumping from a ladder and landing on their feet.\n\nHerniation of a disc occurs when the liquid center of the disc bulges outwards, tearing the external ring of fibers, extrudes into the spinal canal, and compresses a nerve root against the lamina or pedicle of a vertebra, thus causing sciatica.  This extruded liquid from the \"[[nucleus pulposus]]\" may cause inflammation and swelling of surrounding tissue, which may cause further compression of the nerve root in the confined space in the spinal canal. Many herniated discs themselves, however, cause no pain or discomfort: only occasionally does a disc herniation cause sciatica.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Straight-leg-test.gif|thumb|Straight Leg test sometimes used to help diagnose a lumbar herniated disc]]\nSciatica is typically diagnosed by physical examination, and the history of the symptoms.<ref name=Valat2010/> Generally if a person reports the typical radiating pain in one leg as well as one or more neurological indications of nerve root tension or neurological deficit, sciatica can be diagnosed.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=1313\u20131317 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39223.428495.BE |title=Diagnosis and treatment of sciatica |year=2007 |last1=Koes |first1=B W |last2=Van Tulder |first2=M W |last3=Peul |first3=W C |journal=BMJ |volume=334 |issue=7607 |pmid=17585160 |pmc=1895638}}</ref>\n\nThe most applied diagnostic test is the straight leg raise to produce [[Las\u00e8gue's sign]], which is considered positive if pain in the distribution of the sciatic nerve is reproduced with passive flexion of the straight leg between 30 and 70 degrees.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Speed|first=C|title=Low back pain.|journal=BMJ |date=May 8, 2004|volume=328|issue=7448|pages=1119\u201321|pmid=15130982|doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7448.1119|pmc=406328}}</ref> While this test is positive in about 90% of people with sciatica, approximately 75% of people with a positive test do not have sciatica.<ref name=Valat2010/>\n\nImaging tests such as [[computerised tomography]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging]] can help with the diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation.<ref name=\"Gregory et al.\">{{cite journal |pmid=18841731 |url=http://www.aafp.org/link_out?pmid=18841731 |year=2008 |last1=Gregory |first1=DS |last2=Seto |first2=CK |last3=Wortley |first3=GC |last4=Shugart |first4=CM |title=Acute lumbar disk pain: navigating evaluation and treatment choices |volume=78 |issue=7 |pages=835\u201342 |journal=American Family Physician}}</ref> The utility of [[Magnetic resonance neurography|MR neurography]] in the diagnoses of piriformis syndrome is controversial.<ref name=Miller2012/>\n\n==Management==\nWhen the cause of sciatica is [[lumbar disc herniation]], most cases resolve spontaneously over weeks to months.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Casey|first=E|title=Natural history of radiculopathy.|journal=Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America|date=February 2011|volume=22|issue=1|pages=1\u20135|pmid=21292142|doi=10.1016/j.pmr.2010.10.001}}</ref> Initially treatment in the first 6\u20138&nbsp;weeks should be conservative.<ref name=Valat2010/> There does not appear to be a significant difference in outcomes between advice to stay active and recommendations of bed rest.<ref name=Hagen2004>{{cite journal|last=Hagen|first=KB|author2=Hilde, G |author3=Jamtvedt, G |author4= Winnem, M |title=Bed rest for acute low-back pain and sciatica.|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Oct 18, 2004|issue=4|pages=CD001254|pmid=15495012|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001254.pub2}}</ref> Similarly, physical therapy (directed exercise) has not been found better than bed rest.<ref name=\"Luijsterburg1\">{{cite journal |pages=881\u2013899 |doi=10.1007/s00586-007-0367-1 |title=Effectiveness of conservative treatments for the lumbosacral radicular syndrome: a systematic review |year=2007 |last1=Luijsterburg|first1=Pim A.

Research rerouted that the overall goal for treatment of apraxia should be to improve speech intelligibility, rate of speech and articulation of targeted words.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wambaugh|first1=JL|last2=Nessler|first2=C|last3=Cameron|first3=R|last4=Mauszycki|first4=SC|title=Acquired apraxia of speech: the effects of repeated practice and rate/rhythm control treatments on sound production accuracy.|journal=American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology|date=2012|volume=2|pages=S5-S27|doi=10.1044/1058-0360(2011/11-0102|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n==Prognosis==\nThe prognosis for individuals with apraxia varies. With therapy, some patients improve significantly, while others may show very little improvement. Some individuals with apraxia may benefit from the use of a [[Augmentative and alternative communication|communication aid]].\nHowever, many people with apraxia are no longer able to be independent. Those with limb-kinetic and/or gait apraxia should avoid activities in which they might injure themselves or others.\n\nOccupational therapy, physical therapy, and play therapy may be considered as other references to support patients with apraxia.  These team members could work along with the SLP to provide the best therapy for people with apraxia.  However, because people with limb apraxia may have trouble directing their motor movements, occupational therapy for stroke or other brain injury can be difficult.\n\nNo medication has been shown useful for treating apraxia.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Praxis (process)]]\n* [[Aging movement control]]\n* [[Developmental coordination disorder]]\n* [[Lists of language disorders]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n{{refbegin}}\n* Fish, Margaret; \"Here's How to Treat Childhood Apraxia of Speech, Second Edition\".
